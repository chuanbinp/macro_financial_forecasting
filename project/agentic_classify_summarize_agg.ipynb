              " 'Article': 'A legend that has swirled around the dilapidated mansion on Smolenski Street in Athens is that the ghost of the previous owner deters prospective buyers by moaning: “The house is mine.” The Greek government refuses to be spooked. The protected two-story mansion and tower, replete with palm trees in the overgrown gardens, will be sold on Sept. 17 to the highest bidder in an EBay-style Internet auction. Greece is trying to dispel criticism it’s not doing enough to sell real estate pledged as part of its 240 billion-euro ($315 billion) rescue. “It’s literally haunting the Greek budget,” Andreas Taprantzis, executive director for real estate at the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund, said in an interview. It “generates zero income, not even taxes,” he said. Hobbled by red tape, a dearth of demand, political resistance and frequent delays, Greek state asset sales haven’t brought in the revenue demanded by the international lenders who bailed out the country. The creditors have signaled they will be taking a more critical look at the strategies being used when they begin their next quarterly review this month. With more than 70,000 properties ranging from a luxury beach resort on the Athenian coast to a disused car repair shop, real estate accounts for half of the 50 billion euros the government originally pledged to raise from selling assets. Greek EBay For about 1,000 small buildings, offices and homes owned by the state, online auctions have been picked as the best way to quickly and transparently move them off Greece’s books, Taprantzis said, calling it an “E-Bay for Greek real estate.” The process is “smart and efficient,” said Lefteris Farmakis, an analyst at Nomura International in London. “But it’s not going to be easy to generate serious revenue, given the illiquid nature of real estate investments and the legal obstacles they face in Greece.” The fund has sold three properties via e-auctions since they started in July, raising 7.4 million euros, and has a slate of seven properties due for the e-block this month. The assets on sale range from a tract of beachfront property in northern Greece to a four-story office building in central Athens. Starting bids will range from 310,000 euros for No. 4 Smolenski Street, a stone mansion built in the 1930s in the seaside neighborhood of Neo Faliro, to 3.4 million euros for the commercial property. Sales Targets The government is targeting annual sales of 35 million euros to 50 million euros from the online auctions, according to Tapranztis, who was appointed in July 2011. Raising money efficiently from Greek real estate assets is a priority for the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, the troika of lenders who may soon need to discuss options for a third financial package of aid for Greece. Their continued support rests on Greece reducing debt to less than 124 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 from a projected peak of 176 percent this year. The revenue target for asset sales, used to pay down debt, has been repeatedly revised. The initial goal of 50 billion euros by the end of 2015 was scaled back to 24 billion euros by 2020. Greece’s failure in June to sell national gas company Depa SA is the latest setback to the plan. Foreign Managers? The IMF said in June the government should consider bringing in foreign managers to run the asset-sales fund, known as HRADF, should the program run further behind schedule. “If the comprehensive review of the privatization program scheduled for the fall of 2013 suggests that delays are continuing -- in particular that political interference continues to hamper the process -- more far-reaching governance changes to the HRADF must be considered,” it said. For the real estate, the IMF said in a separate report a month later, alternative methods, such as asset securitization, are being assessed to boost revenue beyond what’s currently foreseen in the privatization plan. Taprantzis, 47, said the fund is seeking financial advisers for the securitization and expects to name a winner this month with a view to having a first transaction in the second quarter of 2014, he said. It’s not just ghosts haunting Greece’s real estate market, which Taprantzis describes as “at best, dead.” Six-Year Slump Greece is in a sixth year of recession, with unemployment topping a record 27 percent. House prices dropped almost 12 percent in the second quarter of the year, according to the central bank, and the lifting a foreclosure ban on some properties may damp the market further. While the starting price for Smolenski Street in Athens might look like a bargain, years of neglect is restricting the amount that Greece can raise from the assets. Taprantzis said the sale of a mansion in the traditionally wealthy inner-city neighborhood of Kolonaki in July fetched 1.1 million euros. The property could need as much as 2 million euros in refurbishment costs, so “it’s not for everybody.” The online auctions will be used for assets valued at less than 5 or 6 million euros, Tsaprantzis said. Anything valued at more than that would probably require an international tender. The fund plans to sell another cluster of assets the state owns outside Greece after selling buildings such as a townhouse in Holland Park, one of London’s wealthiest neighborhoods. That may include a Roman hotel bequeathed to the Greek state by a Greek living in Italy , valued at about 14 million euros. A hotel in Athens is also due to be auctioned. The vast majority of assets to be auctioned online have come to the Greek state’s possession through foreclosures, bequests or donations or after their owners died without heirs. “Many people end up with no heirs and eventually the state inherits the property,” Taprantzis said by telephone. “The state is family for all citizens, including the ones with no heirs but with a fortune.” To contact the reporter on this story: Maria Petrakis in Athens at mpetrakis@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephen Foxwell at sfoxwell@bloomberg.net'}"

Cutout values are separated into three main product\\n  types. Fabricated loads are beef cuts taken from an animal\\'\\'s ribs, chuck, round,\\n  loin, brisket, short plate and flank; 50 percent loads are 50 percent lean beef\\n  trimmings. Ground loads may contain 73, 75, or 80 percent ground beef. A typical\\n  refrigerated truckload carries 40,000 pounds. Choice 1-3 grade is a better grade\\n  than Select 1-3, partly because Choice cuts have more fat, or marbling, than Select\\n  cuts. Grade quality is determined using a 1-5 yield grade scale. A rating of 1 is\\n  the highest ratio of muscle to fat, while 5 is the lowest.  Marbling is an important\\n  flavor factor.\\'\\nIndustry: Consumer Staples\\nKeyPoints: \\'- Current boxed beef cutout values: Choice 184.82 and Select 170.07 per\\n  hundredweight, with daily changes +0.58 for Choice and -0.20 for Select.\\n\\n  - Choice/Select spread is 14.75 per hundredweight.\\n\\n  - Total load count traded today: 263.\\n\\n  - Current 5-day simple average cutout values: 183.51 (Choice) and 169.90 (Select).\\n\\n  - National negotiated sales volumes: Choice 119.24 loads (~4,769,758 pounds); Select\\n  74.19 loads (~2,967,743 pounds); Trimmings 38.63 loads (~1,545,263 pounds); Coarse\\n  Grinds 30.54 loads (~1,221,487 pounds).\\'\\n\\nHeadline: U.S. September Small Business Jobs Summary\\nDate: \\'2011-10-06\\'\\nLink: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/u-s-september-small-business-jobs-summary-table-.html\\nArticle: \\'U.S. small business plans to hire declined in September, according to the\\n  National Federation of Independent Business.

(REIS) said. The vacancy rate dropped\\\\\\n  \\\\ to 5.6 percent, the lowest since the third quarter of 2006, the New York-based\\\\\\n  \\\\ property-research company said in a report today. It was 5.9 percent in the previous\\\\\\n  \\\\ three months and 7.1 percent a year earlier. The average monthly effective rent\\\\\\n  \\\\ rose to $1,004 from $997 in the second quarter and $981 in the same period of\\\\\\n  \\\\ 2010. Mounting foreclosures, tighter credit for homebuyers and young people moving\\\\\\n  \\\\ out on their own have increased demand for apartments after the vacancy rate reached\\\\\\n  \\\\ a three-decade high of 8 percent at the end of 2009. Leasing may be starting to\\\\\\n  \\\\ cool as the U.S. unemployment rate sticks above 9 percent and concern grows that\\\\\\n  \\\\ the economy is weakening, Reis said. Apartment demand in the third quarter \\\\u201C\\\\\\n  was good, but maybe not as good as it could have been,\\\\u201D Ryan Severino, senior\\\\\\n  \\\\ economist at Reis, said in a telephone interview. \\\\u201CSentiment turned severely\\\\\\n  \\\\ negative during August and there was a heightened fear of the economy backsliding.\\\\u201D\\\\\\n  \\\\ Landlords saw a net increase in occupied space of about 36,000 units in the third\\\\\\n  \\\\ quarter, fewer than the 42,000 units in the previous three months and 95,000 units\\\\\\n  \\\\ a year earlier, Reis said. The period is usually one of the strongest for apartment\\\\\\n  \\\\ leasing because people tend to move during warmer- weather months and school vacations.\\\\\\n  \\\\ Slower \\\\u2018Unbundling\\\\u2019 Renewed weakness in the labor market slowed a wave\\\\\\n  \\\\ of young people moving out of their parents\\\\u2019 homes or leaving roommates to\\\\\\n  \\\\ rent their own place, a phenomenon known as unbundling, said Donald Davidoff,\\\\\\n  \\\\ head of marketing for Archstone, the apartment owner based in Englewood, Colorado.\\\\\\n  \\\\ The U.S. economy added zero jobs in August, the weakest reading since September\\\\\\n  \\\\ 2010, and the unemployment rate remained at 9.1 percent, according to the Labor\\\\\\n  \\\\ Department. \\\\u201CThe fact that job growth has slowed is certainly not encouraging\\\\\\n  \\\\ additional unbundling,\\\\u201D said Davidoff, whose company owns 434 apartment complexes\\\\\\n  \\\\ across the U.S. \\\\u201CThe pace of that has clearly slowed over the past couple\\\\\\n  \\\\ of months.\\\\u201D Vacancies shrank partly because new completions remain near their\\\\\\n  \\\\ lowest since Reis began tracking the quarterly data in 1999, Severino said. About\\\\\\n  \\\\ 8,200 units came to market in the past three months, the second-lowest quarterly\\\\\\n  \\\\ number of the past 12 years, according to Reis. New supply from developers could\\\\\\n  \\\\ start affecting occupancy rates in late 2012, Reis said. Effective-Rent Gains\\\\\\n  \\\\ Effective rents, or what tenants pay after landlord giveaways are included, rose\\\\\\n  \\\\ on a year-over-year basis in 81 out of the 82 metropolitan areas tracked by Reis.\\\\\\n  \\\\ San Jose , California , led with 5.5 percent growth in effective rents from a\\\\\\n  \\\\ year earlier, followed by San Francisco at 4.5 percent and New York at 3.7 percent,\\\\\\n  \\\\ Reis said. Las Vegas was the only city where rents fell. The 2.3 percent annual\\\\\\n  \\\\ growth nationwide in effective rents outstripped the 2.1 percent annual increase\\\\\\n  \\\\ in landlords\\\\u2019 asking rents, suggesting that concessions continued to decrease\\\\\\n  \\\\ amid strong demand for rental housing, Reis said. Vacancies should decline further\\\\\\n  \\\\ as the number of jobs increases for people ages 20 to 34, the prime group of renters,\\\\\\n  \\\\ said Severino. Lingering pessimism about home prices and the difficulty of qualifying\\\\\\n  \\\\ for mortgages also favor the rental market, he said. Pushing Rents \\\\u201CThe market\\\\\\n  \\\\ hasn\\\\u2019t quite tightened to the point where landlords can really push rents\\\\\\n  \\\\ in excess of inflation,\\\\u201D Severino said. \\\\u201CBut we\\\\u2019re not too far\\\\\\n  \\\\ away. We can envision within the next year or so seeing a figure more in the 3\\\\\\n  \\\\ to 4 percent range\\\\u201D for rent growth. Effective rents have climbed 4.1 percent\\\\\\n  \\\\ from their recession low in 2009, according to Reis. Higher rates may spur people\\\\\\n  \\\\ to double up again, move home or downsize to a less expensive rental, according\\\\\\n  \\\\ to Ron Johnsey, president of Axiometrics Inc., a Dallas-based apartment-research\\\\\\n  \\\\ company. Rent growth is \\\\u201Cdefinitely flattening out,\\\\u201D he said. \\\\u201C\\\\\\n  The operators really pushed rents the first half of the year and then just stood\\\\\\n  \\\\ there to protect those gains,\\\\u201D Johnsey said. \\\\u201CIt looks like that may\\\\\\n  \\\\ be happening again.\\\\u201D William Kendust, a 26-year-old church youth director\\\\\\n  \\\\ in the city of Melbourne on Florida \\\\u2019s eastern shore, moved back in with\\\\\\n  \\\\ his parents in January after sharing an apartment with his brother and a friend\\\\\\n  \\\\ for two years. \\\\u201CI just felt that it would be throwing money away to rent\\\\\\n  \\\\ a place before I was ready\\\\u201D to buy a house, said Kendust, who plans to stay\\\\\\n  \\\\ at home longer to help his mom after his father died unexpectedly. \\\\u201CA lot\\\\\\n  \\\\ of young people in their 20s want to be able to get up and go, and the opportunity\\\\\\n  \\\\ of going back to school is a draw,\\\\u201D Kendust said. \\\\u201CLiving with their\\\\\\n  \\\\ parents for a while gives them the freedom to do that.\\\\u201D To contact the reporter\\\\\\n  \\\\ on this story: Hui-yong Yu in Seattle at  hyu@bloomberg.net ; Katie Spencer in\\\\\\n  \\\\ New York at  kspencer14@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this\\\\\\n  \\\\ story: Kara Wetzel at  kwetzel@bloomberg.net\"\\nIndustry: Real Estate\\nKeyPoints: \"- U.S. apartment vacancies fell to 5.6% in Q3 2011, the lowest since Q3\\\\\\n  \\\\ 2006, signaling tighter rental conditions.\\\\n- Average monthly effective rent increased\\\\\\n  \\\\ to $1,004, up from $997 in Q2 and $981 a year earlier, with 81 of 82 metros posting\\\\\\n  \\\\ year-over-year rent gains.\\\\n- Demand remained solid despite tepid job growth,\\\\\\n  \\\\ aided by foreclosures, tight mortgage credit, and more young people moving out;\\\\\\n  \\\\ unemployment stood at 9.1%.\\\\n- New supply remained restrained, with about 8,200\\\\\\n  \\\\ new units in the quarter\\\\u2014the second-lowest in 12 years\\\\u2014producing a net\\\\\\n  \\\\ occupied-space gain of roughly 36,000 units, below prior quarters.\\\\n- Rent growth\\\\\\n  \\\\ remains modest but steady: nationwide effective rents rose 2.3% year over year\\\\\\n  \\\\ (vs 2.1% for asking rents), and top metros showed strong gains (San Jose 5.5%,\\\\\\n  \\\\ San Francisco 4.5%, New York 3.7%), while Las Vegas rents fell.\"\\n\\nHeadline: SEC Claims Author Used Ponzi Scheme to Repay Prior Fraud Victims\\nDate: \\'2011-10-06\\'\\nLink: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/sec-gets-court-order-to-halt-alleged-26-million-ponzi-scheme.html\\nArticle: \"Eric J.

Tombini\\\\u2019s use of the word \\\\u201Cmoderate\\\\u201D\\\\\\n  \\\\ points to a rate cut of 50 basis points, rather than the 75 basis-point cut that\\\\\\n  \\\\ some traders are betting on, said Andre Perfeito , an economist with Gradual Investimentos\\\\\\n  \\\\ in Sao Paulo. Estado do S.

Brazil\\\\u2019s economy showed clear signs\\\\\\n  \\\\ of slowing in August and will grow 3.5 percent this year, Tombini said. Given\\\\\\n  \\\\ slower domestic growth and the impact of the global crisis, policy makers decided\\\\\\n  \\\\ to cut rates in August, he said.

Lone Star Fined Paul Yoo, the former head of Lone\\\\\\n  \\\\ Star\\\\u2019s South Korean unit, was sentenced yesterday to three years in prison\\\\\\n  \\\\ by Judge Cho Kyung Ran. Lone Star was fined 25 billion won ($21 million) by the\\\\\\n  \\\\ court. Korea Exchange Bank (004940) was found not guilty, Cho said after presiding\\\\\\n  \\\\ over a retrial ordered by the Supreme Court this year following their acquittal\\\\\\n  \\\\ in June 2008. Judge Cho said Yoo spread false rumors of a possible capital reduction\\\\\\n  \\\\ at Korea Exchange Bank\\\\u2019s credit card unit in 2003, with the intention of\\\\\\n  \\\\ driving down its value before the lender merged it. The case brought into question\\\\\\n  \\\\ whether Lone Star is a legitimate shareholder of Korea Exchange Bank and regulators\\\\\\n  \\\\ have waited on its outcome before approving a change in ownership. \\\\u2018It Doesn\\\\u2019\\\\\\n  t Matter\\\\u2019 \\\\u201CIt doesn\\\\u2019t matter whether Lone Star voluntarily sells\\\\\\n  \\\\ the stake or is forced to do so,\\\\u201D Kim Sung Yong, a law professor at Sungkyunkwan\\\\\\n  \\\\ University in Seoul, said before the judgment. \\\\u201CThe result is the same: exit\\\\\\n  \\\\ from its investment as it has wished.\\\\u201D Korea Exchange Bank spokesman Lee\\\\\\n  \\\\ Sun Hwan said the company respects the court\\\\u2019s decision on the lender.

Jed Repko, a spokesman for Lone\\\\\\n  \\\\ Star in New York , declined to comment on the court\\\\u2019s decision and on whether\\\\\\n  \\\\ the fund will appeal to the highest court again. He also declined to comment on\\\\\\n  \\\\ the regulator\\\\u2019s remarks that the commission may order Lone Star to sell 41\\\\\\n  \\\\ percent stake in Korea Exchange.

Lone Star, which bought Korea Exchange Bank in 2003, first\\\\\\n  \\\\ tried to sell the lender to Kookmin Bank in 2006, and the deal was thwarted amid\\\\\\n  \\\\ the same legal dispute. Then in 2008, HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) walked away from\\\\\\n  \\\\ a $6 billion deal to buy Korea Exchange as regulators delayed approval, citing\\\\\\n  \\\\ the case. While the court proceedings have postponed Lone Star\\\\u2019s exit, it\\\\\\n  \\\\ has profited from the investment. The U.S. fund has recovered 2.5 trillion won\\\\\\n  \\\\ after tax through block share sales and dividends out of a 2.15 trillion won investment\\\\\\n  \\\\ in Korea Exchange, according to the bank\\\\u2019s data.

The Universal Service Fund supports phone service\\\\\\n  \\\\ to schools, libraries, the poor and high-cost areas. The fund is financed by charges\\\\\\n  \\\\ on long-distance calls paid by telephone subscribers, and it subsidizes companies\\\\\\n  \\\\ including Windstream Corp. (WIN) and Frontier Communications Corp. (FTR)  In 2010,\\\\\\n  \\\\ the program paid $4.3 billion to carriers doing business in high-cost areas, according\\\\\\n  \\\\ to the website of the Universal Service Administrative Company , a Washington-based\\\\\\n  \\\\ independent nonprofit group that administers the fund. More than 1,700 carriers\\\\\\n  \\\\ receive support from the program for high-cost areas. Senator Jay Rockefeller\\\\\\n  \\\\ , a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce committee, called for\\\\\\n  \\\\ an Oct. 12 hearing to discuss the proposed reforms. Details of the plan announced\\\\\\n  \\\\ today have not been released publicly by the FCC. High-Cost Subsidy Genachowski\\\\\\n  \\\\ has singled out the subsidy program for high- cost regions as one possible source\\\\\\n  \\\\ of money for broadband expansion. The agency voted in February to develop the\\\\\\n  \\\\ USF overhaul, and since then has held workshops across the country. The FCC also\\\\\\n  \\\\ plans to revamp the fees paid to rural carriers for connecting calls, Genachowski\\\\\\n  \\\\ said. The changes would be phased in over several years, he said. Changes to so-called\\\\\\n  \\\\ intercarrier connection fees \\\\u201Cwill result in significant consumer benefits,\\\\u201D\\\\\\n  \\\\ Genachowski said. \\\\u201CConsumers can expect reduced costs, better value for their\\\\\\n  \\\\ money, or both.\\\\u201D A coalition of telephone companies led by AT&T Inc. (T)\\\\\\n  \\\\ and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) in July asked the FCC to reduce those fees,\\\\\\n  \\\\ which can amount to as much as $8 billion annually. Bob Quinn, AT&T\\\\u2019s senior\\\\\\n  \\\\ vice president-federal regulatory, said the company was committed to working with\\\\\\n  \\\\ the FCC on the changes to the Universal Service Fund and intercarrier compensation.\\\\\\n  \\\\ Loitering Rules \\\\u201CAbsent reform, these rules will simply loiter on to foster\\\\\\n  \\\\ more litigation and arbitrage, and ultimately stifle innovation and the benefits\\\\\\n  \\\\ of broadband for consumers,\\\\u201D Quinn said in an e-mail. The FCC\\\\u2019s push\\\\\\n  \\\\ to overhaul the USF program may leave \\\\u201Cmom and-pop\\\\u201D telephone providers\\\\\\n  \\\\ behind, David Mitchell, director of the bureau of economic research at Missouri\\\\\\n  \\\\ State University , said in an interview. Small phone companies would likely stop\\\\\\n  \\\\ offering service and be unable to afford the investment needed to become broadband\\\\\\n  \\\\ providers. Their absence in the market may mean that \\\\u201Cthe winners would be\\\\\\n  \\\\ larger corporations,\\\\u201D as AT&T and Verizon take over those markets, he said.\\\\\\n  \\\\ Rural telecommunications providers said they want to ensure that the FCC\\\\u2019\\\\\\n  s plan strengthens their networks.

Saft, based in the Paris suburb of Bagnolet, may benefit from the euro\\\\u2019\\\\\\n  s decline against the dollar as 40 percent of the company\\\\u2019s sales are in the\\\\\\n  \\\\ U.S. currency, a greater proportion than its costs, Searle said. Saft also stands\\\\\\n  \\\\ to gain from a recent drop in the price of nickel, for which at least 60 percent\\\\\\n  \\\\ of needs are hedged six months in advance, the CEO said. Many of Saft\\\\u2019s activities\\\\\\n  \\\\ tied to infrastructure are \\\\u201Clate-cycle\\\\u201D businesses, Searle said. \\\\u201C\\\\\\n  If there is something bad coming in 2012, we wouldn\\\\u2019t expect to be one of the\\\\\\n  \\\\ companies that would necessarily see that first.\\\\u201D Cash From Disposal Searle,\\\\\\n  \\\\ who predicted in July that revenue in 2011 will rise at least 7 percent, is looking\\\\\\n  \\\\ at options for using $145 million in cash the company got from selling its stake\\\\\\n  \\\\ in a car- battery joint venture to Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI)  The French manufacturer\\\\\\n  \\\\ must refinance about 330 million euros ($440 million) of bank loans due in July\\\\\\n  \\\\ 2012 before potentially using the disposal\\\\u2019s proceeds for acquisitions or\\\\\\n  \\\\ returning part of the money to shareholders, he said. Saft\\\\u2019s gross debt is\\\\\\n  \\\\ about 3 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\\\\\\n  \\\\ The net-debt ratio, which amounted to 1.24 times Ebitda in late 2010, may fall\\\\\\n  \\\\ below 1 at the end of this year, Searle said. The best position may be \\\\u201C\\\\\\n  somewhere between\\\\u201D the net and gross figures, as Saft needs to fund sales growth\\\\\\n  \\\\ of the lithium-ion batteries that it started making last month at a plant in Jacksonville,\\\\\\n  \\\\ Florida , he said. Lithium-Ion Technology Lithium-ion technology will probably\\\\\\n  \\\\ help Saft boost revenue by 10 percent a year from 2012 to 2016, helped by demand\\\\\\n  \\\\ for metering systems installed by utilities and applications in renewable-energy\\\\\\n  \\\\ storage and the aerospace industry , the company said in June. The manufacturer\\\\\\n  \\\\ plans to reduce the cost of making these high-power batteries, which boast a faster\\\\\\n  \\\\ recharge time and longer life cycle. Provided that the \\\\u201Cideal capital structure\\\\\\n  \\\\ leaves us with an excess of cash\\\\u201D once the company has refinanced bank debt,\\\\\\n  \\\\ one option would be to look at \\\\u201Cways to distribute some of that to our shareholders,\\\\u201D\\\\\\n  \\\\ Searle said. The company needs to keep flexibility for \\\\u201Crelatively modest\\\\u201D\\\\\\n  \\\\ acquisitions in emerging markets to reduce the share of sales from Europe and\\\\\\n  \\\\ the U.S., he said.

In the 2008-9 season taxes averaged 25.3 percent of international prices, the IMF said in a document posted on its website in November last year. While the country met the commitment in the season just ended, it had a change in government earlier this year. The rate meets a demand by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to reform the Ivorian cocoa and coffee industries in order to comply with the terms of its Heavily Indebted Poor Countries’ debt-relief program. Last year, the fixed duty on cocoa beans was scrapped and replaced with a levy that varies with prices as part of the reforms that will make the country eligible for $3 billion in debt relief from the Washington-based lenders. The document from the Abidjan-based ministry is dated Oct. 3 and applies to the 2011-12 harvest season, which began on Oct. 1. It was obtained by Bloomberg and hasn’t been publicly released. Norbert Komenan, an adviser to Finance Minister, Charles Koffi Diby, declined to comment when called today. The main export tax has been maintained at 14.6 percent. There are a number of other charges. Cocoa traded at $2,648 a metric ton in New York as of 11:03 a.m. local time. Disputed Election Discussions of the reform strategy with the World Bank are expected to resume in coming months, the IMF said on its website in July, two months after Alassane Ouattara was sworn in as president following a violent five-month political crisis that was sparked by a disputed November election. Cocoa and coffee exports were largely halted during that time, as Ouattara attempted to limit the flow of funds to Laurent Gbagbo , who refused to cede power despite losing the election. Businesses also shut their doors as customers stayed home and banks closed their branches amid the clashes. As many as 3,000 people were killed, according to the International Criminal Court , which is investigating crimes it says were committed by supporters of both leaders. Ivory Coast’s economy may contract 5.8 percent this year before expanding 8.5 percent in 2012, the ministry said last month.

Cutout values are separated into three main product types. Fabricated loads are beef cuts taken from an animal\\'s ribs, chuck, round, loin, brisket, short plate and flank; 50 percent loads are 50 percent lean beef trimmings. Ground loads may contain 73, 75, or 80 percent ground beef. A typical refrigerated truckload carries 40,000 pounds. Choice 1-3 grade is a better grade than Select 1-3, partly because Choice cuts have more fat, or marbling, than Select cuts. Grade quality is determined using a 1-5 yield grade scale. A rating of 1 is the highest ratio of muscle to fat, while 5 is the lowest.

Hundt, who was chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission from 1993 to 1997, is working with the government as well as Silicon Valley venture capital and private equity firms to ensure that money is still available for clean-energy projects after the collapse of Solyndra LLC last month. “Step one is that the Silicon Valley venture community has to stand up for the fundamental idea that success can come from failure,” Hundt said in an interview at a clean-tech conference yesterday in Redwood City, California. “And this is a Congress that hates taxes, so how about eliminating all income tax on the sale of clean-energy goods or services for the next decade.” Solyndra, a solar-panel maker in Fremont, California , fired 1,100 workers and filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 6, two years after receiving a $535 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy. The company’s downfall doesn’t change the need for the production of biofuels, solar power and technology that helps reduce energy consumption, Hundt said. State Initiatives In addition to making proposals to Congress, Hundt’s Washington-based nonprofit is working with individual states to make capital more available. In June, Connecticut adopted a measure for a so-called green bank, designed to provide low-cost financing for energy-efficiency projects. The project will be funded by a surcharge on residential and commercial electric bills amounting to about $30 million a year. Legislators in Oregon , Michigan , Pennsylvania , Ohio and New York have reached out to Hundt’s coalition to do something similar, he said. Venture funding of clean-tech companies fell 4.5 percent in the first half of this year to $2.17 billion from $2.27 billion a year earlier, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Still, the $1.23 billion invested in the first quarter marked the second-highest period ever, after the second quarter of 2010, the NVCA said. That won’t slow down just because Solyndra is being scrutinized, said Jim Fulton, co-chair of the clean energy and technologies group at law firm Cooley LLP in Palo Alto, California, which sponsored the conference. Congressional Republicans are leading an investigation into Solyndra’s loan guarantee, and the company faces a probe by the FBI. “Solyndra will not be a defining moment in clean-tech history,” Fulton said in an interview. “There is an alternative universe in Washington , D.C., and politics that is blowing this out of proportion.” Hundt, 63, also works with the Aspen Institute , which describes itself as a “venue for discussing and acting on critical issues,” and worked on President Barack Obama’s transition team from 2008 to 2009. He serves on the board of Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s biggest semiconductor company, and Serious Energy Inc., formerly Serious Materials, which provides software for building owners and developers.

Sterling dropped against all but two of its 16 major counterparts, sliding most versus the Australian dollar. The Monetary Policy Committee will leave its key rate unchanged at 0.5 percent, according to all 53 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Eleven of 32 economists surveyed separately predict at least a 50 billion-pound ($77 billion) increase in its so- called quantitative easing program. “There might be a short relief rally in sterling on a lack of further BOE action but it’s likely to be short-lived as the market is still focused on the likelihood of further QE by the November meeting,” said Ian Stannard , London-based head of European currency strategy at Morgan Stanley. “The BOE will move towards further QE in coming months and ultimately sterling will come under pressure.” The pound weakened 0.1 percent to $1.5439 at 8:54 a.m. in London. It declined 0.2 percent to 118.47 yen and was little changed against the euro at 86.36 pence. Morgan Stanley recommends selling the pound on any “relief rallies” that are likely to occur should the central bank refrain from announcing further monetary stimulus for the U.K. economy. The Bank of England has faced pressure to embark on further quantitative easing to help revive an economy battling the steepest government spending cuts since World War II and a worsening euro-area debt crisis. The U.K.’s economy grew less than expected in the second quarter, expanding 0.1 percent from the first three months of the year, the Office for National Statistics said yesterday. That was lower than the 0.2 percent previously published by the statistics body and also missed the 0.2 percent expansion forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

The three-year loan program is likely to come to the board of directors for approval in November, the Washington-based IMF said in an e-mailed statement today. The IMF has said its support was contingent on the country’s strengthening its financial system. “The authorities have made important progress on managing the Kabul Bank crisis that came to the fore in the fall of 2010,” IMF mission chief Axel Schimmelpfennig said in the statement. “The authorities’ program outlines further steps to strengthen and develop Afghanistan’s financial sector.” A loan would signal approval of Afghanistan’s policies, a condition for some governments that provide assistance. The IMF, which reached a similar agreement in July 2010 that never went to the board, had said Afghan authorities needed to prevent a repeat of the conditions that led to the collapse of Kabul Bank before obtaining aid. The government took over Kabul Bank, the country’s biggest commercial financial institution, in September 2010. Thousands of depositors rushed to withdraw their money last year after learning that the bank’s owners had lost hundreds of millions of dollars they had lent to themselves. Recovering Assets “Kabul Bank has been put into receivership, and efforts are under way to recover the embezzled assets from the former shareholders of the bank which will limit the fiscal costs of the crisis,” Schimmelpfennig said. “The central bank is also stepping up supervision and ensuring that the banking law and regulations are fully enforced.” Measures the Afghan government plans to take in exchange for the loan include introducing a value-added tax to make up for the expected decrease in revenue collection when the military withdraws. The IMF said it expects real economic growth of between 6 percent and 8 percent during the program period.

The company has $2.5 billion invested in farmland and owns about 600,000 hectares (1.48 million acres) mostly in the U.S., Brazil and Australia, said Jose Minaya, 40, a managing director and head of natural resources and infrastructure investments at New York-based TIAA-CREF. “From a historical point of view, farmland has generated returns of 8 percent to 12 percent a year and we expect that to continue over the long term,” Minaya said. Farms are attracting investors such as billionaire George Soros as rising incomes in China and India and a growing world population increase demand for food and fuel. Food production will have to climb 70 percent by 2050 as the population rises to 9.2 billion from 6.9 billion in 2010, according to the United Nations. Global food costs reached a record in February after weather ruined crops from Canada to Australia and Russia. The Standard & Poor’s Spot Index of 24 commodities has dropped 21 percent from its April high on concern the European debt crisis would slow growth and curb demand. The gauge had more than doubled since the start of 2009. The MSCI All-Country World Index of global equities lost 22 percent from its May high. ‘Pretty Steady’ Farmland is an asset class that’s “pretty steady” and delivers stable income returns with capital appreciation that tracks slightly above inflation, said Minaya, who previously worked for AIG Global Investment Group and Merrill Lynch & Co. The company is seeking to expand in grain-exporting countries and hold investments for as long as 30 years, he said in an interview Sept. 30. “We can easily be twice the size that we are today” if the right opportunities arise, he said. The pension manager buys land and leases it back to farmers, he said. The investments are in “mature and established” regions, in “the bigger farms” and in countries that export grain, he said. Returns in the past few years have been at the high end of the 8 percent to 12 percent range, he said Sept. 30. “On aggregate, it does look like a pretty good bet,” said Michael Creed , an agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. “We’re entering a period of rapid growth in emerging- market demand for higher protein,” which is increasing use of grains to feed poultry and livestock, he said from Melbourne. Farmland Values TIAA-CREF is one of eight institutional investors representing $1.3 trillion in assets that have endorsed a set of Farmland Principles ranging from environmental sustainability to transparency and respect for land rights, it said on Sept. 6. Farmland values in one of the most-productive regions in the U.S. Midwest soared 17 percent in the second quarter as higher grain prices made real estate more attractive, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said on Aug. 17. The increase from a year ago in the area including Illinois , Indiana , Iowa and Wisconsin was the biggest since the 1970s, it said. A fund controlled by George Soros owns 23 percent of South American farmland venture Adecoagro SA, Bloomberg data show. The company is involved in the production of grains, oilseeds, dairy, sugar, ethanol, coffee, cotton and cattle meat, and has operations in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, its website said. Shrinking land and water supply in countries including China and India, will limit their capacity to boost food production, creating import demand, Minaya said. That’s going to be met by the major exporting regions in North and South America, Australia, and parts of Central and Eastern Europe, he said. As well as the U.S., Australia and Brazil, the company has a smaller level of investments in Poland and Romania , he said.

Workers and management have been tussling over new contracts that will run through 2020. Management has already agreed to offer job guarantees and is seeking 8 percent productivity increases.

(AAPL) fans worldwide mourned the death of co-founder Steve Jobs , paying tribute to the man who changed the way they listen to music, use their mobile phones and play on their computers. At Apple’s headquarters -- located at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California -- flags flew at half-staff and bagpipes sounded to the tune of “Amazing Grace” as people placed flowers around a white iPad with a picture of Jobs, who died yesterday at 56, after a battle with cancer. Mourners flocked to Apple stores from New York to Hong Kong , while a crowd gathered in San Francisco ’s Mission Dolores Park for an iPhone-lit vigil. “Part of the narrative that made Apple what it is today goes out with Steve Jobs,” said Christopher Smith, 40, a former business development manager in San Francisco who joined the vigil. “I came out to honor the fact that one man with vision, courage and unwavering dedication can still change the world. The way that I communicate and the way that I interact with the world is through things that Steve Jobs has created.” Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates and Sony Corp. (6758) Chairman Howard Stringer were among leaders who expressed admiration for the man who built the world’s most valuable technology company. President Barack Obama and former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair also issued statements of sympathy. Jobs’s Home “Michelle and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Steve Jobs,” Obama said in a statement. “Steve was among the greatest of American innovators -- brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it.” While Apple plans a celebration for staff, it doesn’t intend to hold a public ceremony, a person familiar with the matter said. Teary-eyed mourners left flowers in front of Jobs’s modest home at the corner of Waverly Street and Santa Rita Avenue in Palo Alto , California. Neighborhood children drew hearts with markers and left them on the ground for others to leave messages. Policemen stood watch, barricading the street. “Here’s a guy who’s a billionaire and lives in a regular neighborhood, not behind a gated estate with all the security guards,” said Bruce Gee, a former Apple employee who drove up to the house from his home a couple miles away. “On Halloween, people go trick or treating there like everyone else.” At the San Francisco Apple store near Union Square, Steve Streza, 24, stood holding an iPad displaying Apple’s homepage image of Jobs and the words “Steve Jobs: 1955-2011.” ‘Regular Guy’ “Macs were the reason I got into product development,” said Streza, a developer at readitlater.com who grew up with Mac computers. “If it weren’t for Steve Jobs and Macs, my life would probably be in a completely different place right now.” Steve Somerstein, who says he met Jobs several times since 1986, recalled the time when he bumped into Jobs while apartment hunting in Palo Alto. “He was just a regular guy,” said Somerstein, who was at the Palo Alto store. “I congratulated him on the company and hoped it was going to do well. I didn’t even own an Apple at that point. He was about 10 years younger than me and just a nice kid.” Ron Kent, a food-truck owner who was at the Palo Alto store, likened Jobs to Michelangelo, the renaissance-era artist who painted the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. “He’s the visionary of our time,” Kent said. ‘RIP Steve Jobs’ Some mourned via social media sites. More than 20 “RIP Steve Jobs” pages sprung up on Facebook within hours of the announced passing of Jobs. News of Jobs’s death slowed the mobile websites of CNN and the Washington Post, according to Keynote Systems Inc. (KEYN) , which tracks website performance. “Steve Jobs,” the biography written by former Time magazine editor Walter Isaacson, scheduled for release Nov. 21, was the best seller on Amazon.com Inc.’s website. In New York, Jared and Alexi Roth, 33 and 31, left two red apples by the wall outside the Apple store on Broadway in the Upper West Side. “We were literally walking by a market on Broadway when Jared got a text saying Steve Jobs died,” Alexi said. “We saw the apples and just thought it would be appropriate.” Across the ocean, Charanis Chiu, walked in front of the Apple store in Hong Kong to place a sunflower, the logo of the photo-viewing application on the iPhone. “A lot of companies such as Microsoft and Nokia are following in his direction,” said Chiu, a vendor of photographic equipment. “Apple will continue to grow as long as they are going in the right direction.” ‘Insanely Great Honor’ At the store in Shanghai ’s Lujiazui district, an area of about three square meters was set aside at the front for people to pay tribute to Jobs. Microsoft’s Gates praised the man who for decades was both a rival and a partner in the personal-computer industry. “The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come,” Gates said. “For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it’s been an insanely great honor.\\xa0I will miss Steve immensely.” Stephen Elop, chief executive officer of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , said the world lost a “true visionary” in Jobs’s passing. Sachio Kitagawa, 45, was on her way with her son to the Apple store in the Ginza shopping district of Tokyo when she heard the news of Jobs’s passing. “He should receive the Nobel prize,” said Kitagawa, who’s used Apple products for 20 years. “I have a second child who is disabled and even he can use the Macintosh. It shows you how user-friendly Apple products are.” ‘Thank You’ Outside the Apple store a short walk from Frankfurt ’s financial institutions, sunflowers, gerbera daisies and roses were laid alongside a burning candle. “He forged designs which appealed to the mass market and developed technology which you can now find in museums -- not because of its age, but because it was groundbreaking,” said Guenther Uttecht, a 60-year-old artist who uses Apple products to work on abstract photos as he left the shop. At the entrance of the store on Regents Street in London lay a white rose with a hand-written note saying “Rip Steve Jobs. With love from Instagramers London and all Instagramers around the world. You gave us life. Thank you x”. Next to it a passerby had left an apple with a bite out of it, imitating the brand’s iconic logo, alongside a bouquet of lillies. On Rue Halevy, just behind Opera Garnier in central Paris, flowers were tucked into the doors of the Apple store. One bouquet had a card from Mario Baluci, the creative artist at Carre Senart, that said, “Thank you, Steve.” In Singapore , Georgina Koh, 30, recalled the man who inspired her to open her own accessory shop. “The world should remember Steve Jobs’s famous quote ‘Stay Hungry, Stay foolish,’” said Koh, a former Apple worker, in reference to Jobs’s Stanford University commencement speech in 2005. “It’s an honor to have been associated with Apple. It is a company built by a man relentless about creating beautiful products that have changed our lives.” To contact the reporters on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at  dbass2@bloomberg.net ; Douglas Macmillan in New York at  dmacmillan3@bloomberg.net ; Danielle Kucera in New York at  dkucera6@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net', Industry='Information Technology', KeyPoints=\"- Apple co-founder Steve Jobs died at age 56 after a battle with cancer, prompting worldwide mourning and half-mast flags at Apple HQ.\\n- Mourners gathered at Apple stores globally, leaving flowers and paying tribute to Jobs's impact on music, mobile devices, and computing.\\n- Prominent figures from tech and politics, including Bill Gates and Barack Obama, credited Jobs with profound influence and visionary leadership.\\n- Apple planned a staff celebration but did not announce a public memorial; Jobs was remembered as a 'regular guy' despite billionaire status.\\n- The response extended online and culturally, with RIP pages, a best-selling biography, and tributes across cities worldwide such as New York, San Francisco, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and London.\"),\n",

              " AType#Headline:Date:Link:Article:Industry:KeyPointsOptional(Headline='Irish Trophy Home Plunges 75% in Price as Property Millionaires Disappear', Date='2011-10-07', Link='http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/irish-trophy-homes-lose-allure-as-property-millions-disappear.html', Article='A six-bedroom Edwardian house on Ireland’s most expensive street is on the market for one quarter of the price paid when it was bought six years ago, a sign that the country’s property crash isn’t sparing high-end properties. Walford, a house on Shrewsbury Road in Dublin’s affluent embassy belt, previously sold for 58 million euros ($77 million), according to Savills Plc (SVS) , which is offering the empty home for 15 million euros. Interested buyers need to submit bids for the house by Oct. 27 with a 1 million-euro bank draft. Prices for some of Ireland’s trophy homes fell at least as much as the rest of the country’s slumping market after the real-estate collapse drained the fortunes of property-boom millionaires. Thorndene, another house on Shrewsbury Road in Dublin’s Ballsbridge, is on the market for 8 million euros, down from an asking price of 14 million euros in 2009. Prime property prices rose faster than the rest of the market during Ireland’s boom “because there was a lot of people chasing too few properties, which gave them a spike,” said Wade Wise of Beirne & Wise, who has been selling Irish high -end homes for 12 years. “Come the crash, they’ve fallen further.” In property markets including London and Paris, luxury home prices fell less following the financial crisis and recovered more quickly than the broader market on tight supply and investment from abroad. Prices in London neighborhoods such as Knightsbridge and St. John’s Wood exceed their pre-recession peaks. Worse Than Average While prices in Dublin have fallen more than 50 percent on average, top end values are down about 75 percent, Wise said. “The drivers of the bubble, especially those who came in later, tend to be among the bigger victims,” said economist Brian Lucey, an associate finance professor at Trinity College Dublin. Ireland was “unique” because the newly made millionaires chose to buy luxury homes in the country rather than abroad. Luxury home prices during the property boom were “underpinned by wealth that wasn’t really wealth,” he said. Investment in housing rose to almost 15 percent of Ireland’s gross domestic product in 2006, up from about 6 percent in 1996, according to the country’s Economic & Social Research Institute. A home formerly owned by Derek Quinlan, once one of Ireland’s richest men, near Shrewsbury Road may be sold to the Belgian Embassy, said two people with knowledge of the matter. The price range is 2.5 million euros to 2.9 million euros, said one of the people, who declined to be identified because the talks aren’t concluded. Quinlan bought the house in 2006 for 7 million euros, and spent more refurbishing it, the Irish Times reported in March, without citing anyone. Damage Done “In Ireland it always used to be a cycle, but this time we seem to have done a lot of damage so the natural recovery isn’t there,” said real-estate developer Paddy Kelly, who owned three houses on Shrewsbury Road at different times and has now lost control of some of his assets as prices plunged. The identity of Walford’s owner hasn’t been disclosed. Iris Keating an agent at Savills, which is jointly handling the sale with Irish broker Lisney, said it received instructions to sell the house from the trust Matsack Nominees Ltd. While luxury cars crowd the driveways of Walford’s neighbors, the red-brick house is run down after being left uninhabited for more than six years. Visitors step onto a bare cement floor just inside the entrance. The walls have been stripped, wooden floors are exposed and cobwebs hang in some of the rooms of the house. ‘Best Road’ After the 75 percent discount, Walford is drawing expressions of interest from potential buyers, Keating said. “This is the best road in Dublin,” she said. “We have had number of genuine inquiries from people who we know to be serious at this end of the market.” Telecom billionaire Denis O’Brien owns a home in Ballsbridge, about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) south of the city center. The Belgian embassy is on the street, as is the residence of the Finnish ambassador. Paddy Kelly is currently leasing a property on Shrewsbury Road to the Chinese embassy. Residential house prices in Dublin have fallen by 51 percent since the peak of the property boom, according to Ireland’s statistics office. The government took control of five of the country’s six biggest lenders, after real-estate loans soured. In all, Ireland has injected or pledged about 62 billion euros to shore up the financial system. Further to Fall Average house prices may fall as much as 70 percent from the peak if the government doesn’t take action to ensure lenders provide mortgages, according to Ronan Lyons , an economist based at Oxford University who has written on the Irish property market. “There is a huge problem at the moment with the availability of credit,” Lyons said in an interview. “Banks are trying to cut down their loan books, not increase them.” Keating at Savills still expects Walford to sell. She estimates that 1 million euros needs to be spent renovating the property. “There are some people who will compete to have a trophy residence here even now,” said Keating at Savills, without naming any of the interested parties. “People at this end of the market want to keep their business under the radar.” To contact the reporters on this story: Finbarr Flynn in Dublin at  fflynn3@bloomberg.net ; Neil Callanan in London at  ncallanan@bloomberg.net ; To contact the editor responsible for this story: Colin Keatinge at  ckeatinge@bloomberg.net', Industry='Real Estate', KeyPoints=\"- Walford, a six-bedroom Edwardian house on Dublin's Shrewsbury Road, is on sale for 15 million euros, down from 58 million six years earlier.\\n- Thorndene on Shrewsbury Road is on the market for 8 million euros, down from 14 million in 2009.\\n- Luxury home prices in Dublin have fallen about 75% from the peak, with top-end values dropping more than the broader market.\\n- The Dublin luxury boom was underpinned by wealth that wasn’t really wealth, with housing investment rising to about 15% of Ireland's GDP in 2006.\\n- The government intervened to stabilize the financial system, taking control of five of the six biggest lenders and injecting/pledging around 62 billion euros, contributing to tighter credit conditions.\"),\n",

(REIS) said. The vacancy rate dropped to 5.6 percent, the lowest since the third quarter of 2006, the New York-based property-research company said in a report today. It was 5.9 percent in the previous three months and 7.1 percent a year earlier. The average monthly effective rent rose to $1,004 from $997 in the second quarter and $981 in the same period of 2010. Mounting foreclosures, tighter credit for homebuyers and young people moving out on their own have increased demand for apartments after the vacancy rate reached a three-decade high of 8 percent at the end of 2009. Leasing may be starting to cool as the U.S. unemployment rate sticks above 9 percent and concern grows that the economy is weakening, Reis said. Apartment demand in the third quarter “was good, but maybe not as good as it could have been,” Ryan Severino, senior economist at Reis, said in a telephone interview. “Sentiment turned severely negative during August and there was a heightened fear of the economy backsliding.” Landlords saw a net increase in occupied space of about 36,000 units in the third quarter, fewer than the 42,000 units in the previous three months and 95,000 units a year earlier, Reis said. The period is usually one of the strongest for apartment leasing because people tend to move during warmer- weather months and school vacations. Slower ‘Unbundling’ Renewed weakness in the labor market slowed a wave of young people moving out of their parents’ homes or leaving roommates to rent their own place, a phenomenon known as unbundling, said Donald Davidoff, head of marketing for Archstone, the apartment owner based in Englewood, Colorado. The U.S. economy added zero jobs in August, the weakest reading since September 2010, and the unemployment rate remained at 9.1 percent, according to the Labor Department. “The fact that job growth has slowed is certainly not encouraging additional unbundling,” said Davidoff, whose company owns 434 apartment complexes across the U.S. “The pace of that has clearly slowed over the past couple of months.” Vacancies shrank partly because new completions remain near their lowest since Reis began tracking the quarterly data in 1999, Severino said. About 8,200 units came to market in the past three months, the second-lowest quarterly number of the past 12 years, according to Reis. New supply from developers could start affecting occupancy rates in late 2012, Reis said. Effective-Rent Gains Effective rents, or what tenants pay after landlord giveaways are included, rose on a year-over-year basis in 81 out of the 82 metropolitan areas tracked by Reis. San Jose , California , led with 5.5 percent growth in effective rents from a year earlier, followed by San Francisco at 4.5 percent and New York at 3.7 percent, Reis said. Las Vegas was the only city where rents fell. The 2.3 percent annual growth nationwide in effective rents outstripped the 2.1 percent annual increase in landlords’ asking rents, suggesting that concessions continued to decrease amid strong demand for rental housing, Reis said. Vacancies should decline further as the number of jobs increases for people ages 20 to 34, the prime group of renters, said Severino. Lingering pessimism about home prices and the difficulty of qualifying for mortgages also favor the rental market, he said. Pushing Rents “The market hasn’t quite tightened to the point where landlords can really push rents in excess of inflation,” Severino said. “But we’re not too far away. We can envision within the next year or so seeing a figure more in the 3 to 4 percent range” for rent growth. Effective rents have climbed 4.1 percent from their recession low in 2009, according to Reis. Higher rates may spur people to double up again, move home or downsize to a less expensive rental, according to Ron Johnsey, president of Axiometrics Inc., a Dallas-based apartment-research company. Rent growth is “definitely flattening out,” he said. “The operators really pushed rents the first half of the year and then just stood there to protect those gains,” Johnsey said. “It looks like that may be happening again.” William Kendust, a 26-year-old church youth director in the city of Melbourne on Florida ’s eastern shore, moved back in with his parents in January after sharing an apartment with his brother and a friend for two years. “I just felt that it would be throwing money away to rent a place before I was ready” to buy a house, said Kendust, who plans to stay at home longer to help his mom after his father died unexpectedly. “A lot of young people in their 20s want to be able to get up and go, and the opportunity of going back to school is a draw,” Kendust said. “Living with their parents for a while gives them the freedom to do that.” To contact the reporter on this story: Hui-yong Yu in Seattle at  hyu@bloomberg.net ; Katie Spencer in New York at  kspencer14@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Kara Wetzel at  kwetzel@bloomberg.net', Industry='Real Estate', KeyPoints='- U.S. apartment vacancies fell to 5.6% in Q3 2011, the lowest since Q3 2006, signaling tighter rental conditions.\\n- Average monthly effective rent increased to $1,004, up from $997 in Q2 and $981 a year earlier, with 81 of 82 metros posting year-over-year rent gains.\\n- Demand remained solid despite tepid job growth, aided by foreclosures, tight mortgage credit, and more young people moving out; unemployment stood at 9.1%.\\n- New supply remained restrained, with about 8,200 new units in the quarter—the second-lowest in 12 years—producing a net occupied-space gain of roughly 36,000 units, below prior quarters.\\n- Rent growth remains modest but steady: nationwide effective rents rose 2.3% year over year (vs 2.1% for asking rents), and top metros showed strong gains (San Jose 5.5%, San Francisco 4.5%, New York 3.7%), while Las Vegas rents fell.'),\n",

Traders pared bets today that the central bank will accelerate the pace of cuts after slashing the benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 12 percent on Aug. 31. The yield on the contract maturing in January 2013, the most traded in Sao Paulo today, rose 14 basis points to 10.36 percent at 5:01 p.m. New York time. Tombini’s use of the word “moderate” points to a rate cut of 50 basis points, rather than the 75 basis-point cut that some traders are betting on, said Andre Perfeito , an economist with Gradual Investimentos in Sao Paulo. Estado do S. Paulo reported Oct. 2 that President Dilma Rousseff wants the Selic rate to fall to 9 percent next year, citing three government officials that it didn’t identify. ‘Getting Worse’ “The bets on 75 basis points or even 100 basis points are driven by two main reasons: the belief that the situation in Europe is getting worse, and this talk about the monetary stance that Dilma Rousseff wanted next year,” Perfeito said. Consumer prices rose 7.33 percent in the year through mid- September, exceeding the 6.5 percent upper limit of the bank’s target range for a fifth straight month. Tombini pledged to slow inflation to 4.5 percent by the end of next year. Jankiel Santos , chief economist at Espirito Santo Investment Bank, said there is no case for speeding up the pace of rate cuts without evidence that the Brazilian economy is really being hit by the problems in Europe. Brazil’s economy showed clear signs of slowing in August and will grow 3.5 percent this year, Tombini said. Given slower domestic growth and the impact of the global crisis, policy makers decided to cut rates in August, he said. Brazil hasn’t abandoned its policy of accumulating foreign reserves, and the central bank will resume its dollar purchases when market conditions permit, Tombini said. He added that the central bank is ready to intervene in currency markets when movements in the real are not consistent with the dollar’s global trend. Brazil has $349 billion in international reserves, up 21 percent from the start of the year. The real appreciated 2.8 percent to 1.7811 per U.S. dollar.

Protection on $10 million of securities for 10 years cost as much as $245,000 this week, according to London-based data provider CMA. That’s the most since Jan. 7, three weeks after banking analyst Meredith Whitney predicted “hundreds of billions of dollars” of defaults in the coming year. Instead, failures plunged to $1.1 billion, a quarter of 2010’s rate, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Prices of privately traded credit-default swap contracts have risen 78 percent since May 31 even after states closed a projected $32 billion in budget deficits, according to the Washington-based National Conference of State Legislatures. States and localities have also recorded seven straight quarters of year-over-year revenue growth, the U.S. Census Bureau said, while enjoying the longest stretch of rising income and falling interest rates since Bill Clinton ’s presidency. While states and cities are balancing budgets and slashing borrowing costs, investors are buying hedges against defaults on concern about a slowing global economy, said Peter Demirali, who manages $350 million of municipal debt at Cumberland Advisors in Mendham Township, New Jersey. “Revenues are increasing,” Demirali said in a telephone interview. “They’re laying off workers and restructuring health and pension benefits. So the risk isn’t really any higher, it’s just that risk around the globe has moved higher.” Economies Slow U.S. gross domestic product growth may slow to 1.6 percent this year from 3 percent in 2010, while Europe ’s expansion rate may cool to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. A credit-default insurance contract based on the Markit MCDX credit-default swaps index reached a record of 340 basis points in December 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings. While CDS prices were rising, yields on municipal bonds had already begun plummeting to the lowest levels in at least six years, according to Bloomberg Fair Value data. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Prices of the privately traded contracts next peaked on June 30, 2010, two weeks after 10-year muni yields began a 29 percent drop lasting through early September. The 2011 high for the CDS index was in January after Whitney’s appearance on CBS’s “60 Minutes” on Dec. 19. By mid-February, municipal debt had started an eight-month rally that pushed interest rates to the lowest levels since 1967, when Lyndon B. Johnson was president. Default Drop About 64 percent of municipal bankers, advisers and government officials expect the number of defaults to drop or remain the same this year compared with 2010, according to an RBC Capital Markets survey conducted at a Bond Buyer conference in Carlsbad, California last month. Credit-default swap costs may not be a precise gauge of risk, said Tom Dresslar , a spokesman for California Treasurer Bill Lockyer. The biggest borrower in the $2.9 trillion municipal market saw the price of protecting its debt for 10 years jump to 286 basis points yesterday from 247 basis points on Sept. 29, according to data from CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. “Anyone who tried to divine the reasons for movement in municipal CDS prices is on a fool’s errand,” Dresslar said in an e-mail. “There is no rhyme or reason. That’s probably because the entire market has no basis in reality.” Ratio Increase The rise in credit default swaps has accompanied an increase in the ratio of 10-year municipal yields to similarly maturing U.S. government-bond rates. The yields on tax-exempt debt have been at or above 100 percent of Treasuries for five straight weeks, the longest stretch since May 2009, according to Bloomberg data. Still, investors in September added $1.9 billion to tax- exempt funds, the biggest monthly inflow since September 2010 when buyers added $2.6 billion, according to Lipper US Fund Flows. States and cities are set to issue $75 billion in the last three months of 2010, up from an earlier projection of $60 million, as issuers take advantage of plunging interest rates , Chris Mauro, a municipal-debt investment strategist for RBC Capital Markets in New York wrote in a report last month. Yields on 10-year top-rated municipals were 2.36 percent yesterday, after falling to 2.13 percent on Sept. 27, the lowest level since March 1991, when Bloomberg data for the securities begins.

The State Bank of Vietnam raised the refinancing rate to 15 percent from 14 percent, effective Oct. 10, it said in a statement on its website yesterday. The central bank weakened the dong’s reference exchange rate for the third straight day today, to 20,653 per dollar from 20,648 per dollar. Vietnam has struggled to regain investor confidence hurt by inflation of more than 20 percent, a trade deficit and risks in the banking sector. While the rate increase is welcome, the central bank should further tighten monetary conditions if necessary to reassure the market that economic stability remains its top priority, the International Monetary Fund said. “Vietnam had to raise rates, but a rate hike won’t change the weaker dong trend,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian and emerging-markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. “The country has a trade deficit and like many other Asian nations now, money is not flowing into Vietnam either due to risk aversion. The dong will continue to see downward pressure.” The currency was little changed at 20,843 per dollar as of 12:00 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The weakening of the reference exchange rate on Oct. 5 was the first change since Aug. 24. The dong was devalued for the fourth time in 15 months on Feb. 11, by about 7 percent, partly to help curb the trade gap. The VN Index of stocks fell 0.8 percent. No ‘Huge Effect’ The rate increase is “unlikely to have a huge effect on lowering inflation,” Masato Miyazaki, the IMF’s Washington-based mission chief for Vietnam, said in an e-mailed statement received today. The central bank should abolish the cap on deposit rates for dong to “help normalize the monetary transmission mechanism,” Miyazaki said. Asian currencies from the Philippine peso to South Korea ’s won have tumbled against the dollar over the past month, as concern the world economy faces a slump prompts investors to pare bets on emerging markets. Confidence in the dong is “shaky,” according to Viet Capital Securities, which said yesterday the currency was trading at 21,500 per dollar on the black market. The trade deficit widened to $1 billion in September from a revised $396 million in August. Policy Efficiency Vietnam’s move is the first change to a key interest rate under new central bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh and contrasts with neighbors such as Malaysia and China , which left borrowing costs unchanged in recent weeks to shield their economies. The increase in the refinancing rate is aimed at improving “the efficiency of monetary policy” and regulating “market interest rates,” the central bank said in yesterday’s statement. It left its repurchase rate at 14 percent and its discount rate at 13 percent. The State Bank of Vietnam increased the repurchase, refinancing and discount rates earlier this year in an attempt to stem credit growth, slow price gains and stabilize the economy. It raised the repurchase rate in nine steps from 7 percent at the start of November last year to 15 percent in May 2011, before cutting it in July to 14 percent. The government said in August the central bank will consider lowering rates if inflation slows. The latest refinancing rate increase is “an encouraging sign, but we’ll have to see whether it continues,” said Thomas Harr , head of Asian foreign-exchange strategy at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. “Because interest rates in Vietnam are too low, you have a lot of money shifting into gold.” Gold-Backed Loans The State Bank of Vietnam asked commercial banks to provide details of gold-backed loans issued since the start of the year until Oct. 7, according to a separate statement dated yesterday and posted on its website today. Commercial banks will also be obliged to file weekly reports on gold-backed lending to the central bank, with the first reports due Oct. 12, it said. The reporting will help the central bank monitor and stabilize the gold and foreign-exchange markets, it said. The July rate reduction and a government push in August for lower commercial borrowing costs “have created uncertainties about the monetary policy strategy,” Trinh Nguyen, a Hong Kong- based economist at HSBC Holdings Plc, wrote in a note released yesterday before the rate increase was announced. Consumer prices climbed 22.42 percent in September from a year earlier, compared with 23.02 percent in August. Vietnam’s inflation rate remains the fastest in a basket of 17 Asian- Pacific economies tracked by Bloomberg. The central bank yesterday also raised overnight interest rates on electronic transactions to 16 percent from 14 percent, effective Oct. 10. Domestic economic imbalances pose a risk to Vietnamese banks’ asset quality, Moody’s Investors Service said last month. Vietnam’s gross domestic product may rise 5.8 percent in 2011, the slowest pace since 2009, Asian Development Bank data show. The economy, a production hub for companies from Intel Corp. (INTC) to Honda Motor Co., expanded 6.8 percent in 2010.

Tokyo-based Orix may buy an investment management firm or take over a team of fund managers and research staff in the U.S. to start investing in stocks, Deputy President Haruyuki Urata said in an interview in Tokyo on Oct. 3. The company has been in talks with “several firms,” he said, declining to name potential targets or say how much Orix would spend. The financial company aims to boost its asset-management operations in the U.S. and Asia by adding equity-related investment products to its fixed-income portfolio. The firm acquired stakes last year in a U.S. hedge fund manager that invests mainly in debt, and a Vietnamese investment company. “We want to diversify our products and client network by expanding into equity investments and attracting Asian investors,” said Urata, 56, who is also chief financial officer. “It’s crucial to show our stakeholders that we are always challenging ourselves and eying new things.” Shares of Orix, which got about 14 percent of its revenue from the Americas last fiscal year, have fallen 26 percent this year, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average shed 17 percent. The shares rose 3.3 percent to 5,880 yen today. Good Timing “The U.S. market is the most important for the asset management business in terms of size and potential,” said Yoku Ihara, an investment adviser at Retela Crea Securities Co. in Tokyo. “It’s positive to see the firm is aggressively trying an acquisition and it’s good timing because of the yen’s appreciation.” Overseas investors account for 52 percent of the company’s shareholders. The yen has climbed 12 percent against the dollar in the past six months, the only one of 16 major currencies to advance. Orix purchased 25 percent of Ho Chi Minh City-based Indochina Capital Corp. , which operates real estate funds with $500 million under management, in November. It also acquired in December a majority holding in Harrison, New York-based Mariner Investment Group LLC, which manages about $11.7 billion. The firm aims to double assets under Mariner Investment within five years to more than $20 billion, Orix USA Corp. President James Thompson said in an interview in October 2010. Orix, formed in 1964, has about 18,000 employees and 883 subsidiaries and affiliates in more than 25 countries, according to its website. The company posted a 44 percent gain in profit for the three months ended June to 23.7 billion yen ($309 million), driven by investment banking and overseas businesses. Orix also plans to add new markets for its financing, and will sell 400 million yuan ($63 million) of bonds by March 31 in Hong Kong , while considering raising funds in Australia , Thailand , South Korea , Singapore and Malaysia, said Urata.

The settlement doesn’t constitute a finding of wrongdoing. “There are no excuses for sloppy practices that could lead to someone mistakenly losing their home,” Bharara said in the statement. “Homeowners facing foreclosure cannot afford to have faulty paperwork or inadequate evidence submitted, and today’s agreement will help minimize that risk.” Steven J. Baum PC, located in Amherst, New York, just north of Buffalo, has attracted lawsuits and fines for its actions during the housing crisis. It has been accused of overcharging, filing false documents and representing parties on both sides of a mortgage transfer. State attorneys general and federal regulators are negotiating with banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) to try to reach a settlement over faulty foreclosure practices in the wake of the financial crisis. The changes in procedure “go over and above what current law requires,” Baum said in an e-mailed statement. “We will continue to adhere to the highest ethical standards.” Shares Address Pillar Processing LLC, which processes foreclosure documents and shares an address with the law firm, is also part of the settlement. Pillar is owned by Manhattan private-equity firm Tailwind Capital LLC, according to its website. Brooke Gordon, spokeswoman for Tailwind Capital, declined to comment on the settlement. Baum acknowledged that the firm “occasionally made inadvertent errors in its legal filings in state and federal court, which it attributes to human error in light of the high volume of mortgage defaults and foreclosures,” according to Bharara’s statement. The agreement calls for the firm’s employees to halt their practice of assigning mortgages as supposed employees of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems Inc., an electronic database of mortgages. ‘No Connection’ “Until recently, employees of Baum, with the consent of MERS, had been assigning mortgages on behalf of MERS, even though they had no connection to MERS whatsoever,” according to Bharara’s statement. MERS, a unit of Reston, Virginia-based Merscorp Inc., was set up by the mortgage industry to allow banks to assign and reassign home loans without having to record the changes with county land-records offices. Janis Smith, a MERS spokeswoman, didn’t have an immediate comment on the MERS allegation. The agreement calls for the Baum firm to obtain affidavits from clients attesting that they have the original promissory notes or have searched for them, to have experienced attorneys supervise the preparation of documents and to implement a training program for its attorneys. MERS Assignments “Borrowers and some courts have been questioning the validity of MERS assignments, pleadings and affidavits from the Baum firm for several years,” Jennifer Sinton, deputy director of the foreclosure-prevention project at South Brooklyn Legal Services, said in an interview. “It’s good to see that Baum is now required to discontinue these practices. Hopefully, this will protect courts and homeowners from bogus foreclosure lawsuits.” New York State Supreme Court Justice Arthur M. Schack in Brooklyn called the Baum firm’s explanations in one case “so incredible, outrageous, ludicrous and disingenuous that they should have been authored by the late Rod Serling.” Schack threw out the case in part because he said the assignment of the loan by a Baum lawyer on behalf of MERS as nominee of the lender had been done improperly. The same day, the Baum firm represented the buyer of the loan by filing the foreclosure action, the judge said. Schack said it was a conflict for the firm to represent both sides. “Steven J. Baum PC appears to be operating in a parallel mortgage universe, unrelated to the real universe,” the judge wrote in that May 2010 decision. “Next stop, the Twilight Zone,” he said, quoting from Serling’s TV series about science fiction and the supernatural. Baum said last year that in several cases where Schack stated the firm represented both sides in a mortgage transfer, “we have supplied to the court relevant documentation indicating that no conflict of interest existed.” To contact the reporter on this story: Thom Weidlich in Brooklyn , New York, federal court at  tweidlich@bloomberg.net.

Another California institution, Stanford University , tied with Harvard for second spot in the annual table compiled by the London-based Times Higher Education , with data supplied by Thomson Reuters Corp. The University of Oxford climbed to fourth from sixth last year, beating the University of Cambridge at sixth. Princeton University came fifth. Harvard, the world’s richest university, has topped the rankings since they were started in 2004. The U.S. institution was beaten by Cambridge last month in a separate poll by higher education information provider QS. A 16 percent increase in research funding for Caltech helped it leapfrog Harvard in the Times Higher table, said Phil Baty, editor of the rankings. “The difference between Harvard and Caltech last year was minuscule,” Baty said in a telephone interview. “What’s happened this year is Caltech has seen a significant increase in its research income. A 16 percent increase, it’s quite significant in tipping the balance over in its favor. Harvard had an increase as well, but it was more in line with sector averages.” The rankings are based on a survey that gauges universities across five areas, including industry income, teaching, citations, research and international outlook. More than 17,500 academics were surveyed and 50 million citations analyzed and compared with the world average for this year’s rankings. Funding Levels “It doesn’t seem as if financial crisis has really damaged Harvard,” said Baty. “It still wins on the teaching indicator. Once you factor in research impact and universities’ research activities, Caltech is slightly better.” U.S. and U.K. universities dominated the list, with 75 American schools in the top 200. Seven of the top 10 schools were in the U.S., with the rest in Britain, Imperial College London taking eighth place. “The real issue that’s starting to show is that the great public American universities do seem to be suffering, whereas the private universities in America have managed to maintain or protect their funding levels a bit more,” Baty said. Premier U.S. universities that depend on public funding, including Californian universities at Berkeley , Los Angeles , San Diego and Santa Barbara , had slipped on the list compared with a year ago, Baty said. ‘Steadfast Donors’ “Caltech is fortunate to have steadfast donors and partners whose support gives Caltech the ability to invest in new ideas long before they would be eligible for public funding opportunities,” Dr. Jean-Lou Chameau, president of Caltech, said in an e-mailed statement. “This public-private partnership model enables our research funds to go further.” Oxford beat Cambridge, the U.K.’s richest university, after a change in the survey’s methodology put arts, humanities and social sciences on an equal footing with science, Baty said. “At places like Oxford, where there’s a slightly heavier focus on humanities and social sciences than there is at Cambridge, that levelling of the playing field has helped,” he said. The U.K. had the most number of universities in the top 200 after the U.S., with 32. U.K. Reforms While the U.K. did “exceptionally well,” the “biggest issue is that we’re entering into a very uncertain period of major reform, which will have unforeseen consequences,” Baty said. Higher tuition fee, spending cuts and new visa restrictions on international students restricting university income will affect U.K. rankings from 2012, he said. “The U.K. is blessed with some truly brilliant universities, more brilliant than the government understands, judging by its hastily concocted higher education reforms, with all the uncertainty they entail,” said Ann Mroz, the editor of the Times Higher, in a report accompanying the list. The Netherlands, Germany and Canada followed the U.S. and U.K. as the countries with most universities on the list. ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , was the highest ranked outside of the U.S. and U.K. at 15th position. The University of Tokyo , in 30th place, was the top-ranked Asian school. Japan has five schools in the top 200, the most of any Asian nation, while Hong Kong has four and China three.

(086790) will push to complete its purchase of Korea Exchange Bank from Lone Star Funds after a Seoul court ruled on a five-year legal dispute that stalled the U.S. buyout fund’s efforts to sell the lender. “We will do our utmost to complete the Korea Exchange Bank takeover to best serve our shareholders,” Hana President Kim Jong Yeol said by telephone yesterday after the Seoul High Court found Lone Star guilty of stock-price manipulation. The company is now waiting for guidance from the financial regulator, which said it may order the Dallas-based fund to sell most of its 51 percent stake. Wrangling with courts and regulators pushed back Hana’s plan to take over the bank by May and derailed two earlier attempts by Lone Star to sell its stake. A public backlash over the profits the fund has made on its eight-year investment may deter foreign takeovers in South Korea, impeding government plans to sell state assets such as Woori Finance Holdings Co. “It has taken too long for the resolution of the KEB-Lone Star case,” Hank Morris, North Asia adviser at Triple A Partners Ltd., said by e-mail before the verdict. The delay “will have had a negative effect upon the plans of global investors in regard to direct investment into Korea.” Hana Financial rose 2.5 percent to 36,400 won at the 3 p.m. close of Seoul trading and climbed as high as 38,400 won. Korea Exchange shares advanced 6.5 percent to 7,750 won after rising as much as 11 percent. The benchmark Kospi index advanced 2.9 percent. Lone Star Fined Paul Yoo, the former head of Lone Star’s South Korean unit, was sentenced yesterday to three years in prison by Judge Cho Kyung Ran. Lone Star was fined 25 billion won ($21 million) by the court. Korea Exchange Bank (004940) was found not guilty, Cho said after presiding over a retrial ordered by the Supreme Court this year following their acquittal in June 2008. Judge Cho said Yoo spread false rumors of a possible capital reduction at Korea Exchange Bank’s credit card unit in 2003, with the intention of driving down its value before the lender merged it. The case brought into question whether Lone Star is a legitimate shareholder of Korea Exchange Bank and regulators have waited on its outcome before approving a change in ownership. ‘It Doesn’t Matter’ “It doesn’t matter whether Lone Star voluntarily sells the stake or is forced to do so,” Kim Sung Yong, a law professor at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, said before the judgment. “The result is the same: exit from its investment as it has wished.” Korea Exchange Bank spokesman Lee Sun Hwan said the company respects the court’s decision on the lender. He declined to comment on the Financial Services Commission’s remark that it may order Lone Star to sell a 41 percent stake. Jed Repko, a spokesman for Lone Star in New York , declined to comment on the court’s decision and on whether the fund will appeal to the highest court again. He also declined to comment on the regulator’s remarks that the commission may order Lone Star to sell 41 percent stake in Korea Exchange. Hana has lost 18 percent since May 12, when the Financial Services Commission said it wouldn’t approve Hana’s proposed acquisition of Korea Exchange until Lone Star’s legal dispute is resolved. The FSC has left the deal in limbo for almost a year because of the litigation, prompting Hana and Lone Star to extend a deadline for the transaction to Nov. 30 from May and trim the purchase price by 6 percent to 4.4 trillion won. Hard Sell Lone Star shouldn’t be allowed to get so high price from the Korea Exchange Bank stake following the conviction, Yu Won Il, an opposite Creative Korea Party lawmaker, said at a parliamentary audit today. “Public will never understand if after being convicted of criminal stock manipulation, Lone Star takes a huge premium from this stake sale,” Yu told Financial Services Commission Chairman Kim Seok Dong today. Lone Star, which bought Korea Exchange Bank in 2003, first tried to sell the lender to Kookmin Bank in 2006, and the deal was thwarted amid the same legal dispute. Then in 2008, HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) walked away from a $6 billion deal to buy Korea Exchange as regulators delayed approval, citing the case. While the court proceedings have postponed Lone Star’s exit, it has profited from the investment. The U.S. fund has recovered 2.5 trillion won after tax through block share sales and dividends out of a 2.15 trillion won investment in Korea Exchange, according to the bank’s data. Hostile Sentiment South Korean civic groups such as Seoul-based SpecWatch Korea have criticized foreign investors including Lone Star for pursuing an “eat-and-flee” strategy of buying companies and selling them quickly, pocketing big profits. Public discord and the U.S. buyout firm’s legal woes have dissuaded foreign investors from acquiring Korean companies, said Henry Seggerman, president of New York-based International Investment Advisers. “The case is extremely negative for any prospective strategic investors,” Seggerman, whose firm manages the $25 million Korea International Investment Fund, said by e-mail before the decision. “Public sentiment is hostile toward profitable overseas investment, not supportive overseas investment.” Overseas takeovers of Korean companies fell to $3.6 billion last year from a record $8.1 billion in 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lone Star was one of the first overseas firms to invest in South Korea following the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis that led the country to accept a $57 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.

(GE) and Ohio State University. “Middle-market businesses have a solid track record for performance through the recession,” GE and the university’s Fisher College of Business said in a report on the study. “Looking forward into 2012, 80 percent of middle-market companies expect to grow over the next 12 months.” Findings from the study, which included 2,028 executives from companies with annual sales of $10 million to $1 billion, were presented today at Ohio State’s Columbus campus during a summit attended by customers of the GE Capital finance unit. While mid-size firms’ payrolls fared better than those of large companies, which cut millions of jobs amid the worst slump since the Depression, the study also found challenges. About 55 percent of participants reported insufficient access to capital markets, 84 percent lacked confidence in the national economy and only 17 percent reported confidence in their local economies. Still, “this is a lot different than 2008,” GE Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt told reporters before the summit. “There’s liquidity, there are pockets of growth and I think people have confidence that they might be able to find the right pockets of growth.” “By their own self-assessment, the data strongly indicates that there is plenty of room to improve overall business performance,” the study found. Executives’ concerns include developing top leaders, attracting new customers and developing new products, according to the report. About 71 percent reported challenges dealing with regulations including tax law, and 45 percent are seeing challenges from global rivals, the survey said. International ‘Heat’ “While many middle-market companies have embraced global markets and are aggressively distributing their products and services in new geographies, many are also facing the heat from international competitors,” the study’s authors wrote. The U.S. has about 200,000 mid-size companies, accounting for about 3 percent of all the nation’s businesses, the study said, citing U.S. Census data. The firms offer 16 percent more jobs per dollar in assets than large companies and about 80 percent more jobs per dollar in revenue, the study indicated. Of the jobs they added from 2007 to 2010, about 500,000 were in the Midwest, a region where large companies eliminated 4.9 million workers. The unemployment rate in Ohio, the nation’s seventh most-populous state, was 9.1 percent in August, matching the U.S. rate. The state has lost 407,000 jobs, or 7.37 percent, during the past decade, federal data show. 20 Versus 2,0000 Nationwide, large companies cut a net 3.7 million jobs from 2007 to 2010, including firms that expanded employment, the GE survey showed. On average, middle-market companies added 20 jobs each, while their large counterparts cut 2,000, the survey said. GE Capital’s own review of about 1,200 middle-market customers and their fiscal health shows less-leveraged balance sheets and fewer paying down debt. That indicates companies may have arrived at a comfortable level of borrowing, Dan Henson, who oversees the Americas, said in an interview last week. “These companies are armored,” GE Capital CEO Mike Neal said today. “The environment may end up being bad, who knows, but at least in the United States companies are much better prepared for the most part, to deal with that.” The finance unit of Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE is among the largest lenders to middle-market companies. The parent company’s chief executive officer, Immelt, heads President Barack Obama’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.

The changes to the program, known as the Universal Service Fund, will help increase access to broadband and spur job creation , Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski said during a speech today in Washington. The agency also plans to revise the fees that smaller regional carriers receive to connect calls, he said. “Broadband has gone from being a luxury to a necessity for full participation in our economy and society,” Genachowski said. “If we want the United States to be the world’s leading market” for innovation, “we need to embrace the essential goal of universal broadband, and reform outdated programs.” Under Genachowski, the FCC has sought to increase the share of people who use high-speed Internet at home to 90 percent from the current 65 percent, according to the agency’s national broadband plan. Between 14 million and 24 million Americans lack access to broadband, “and immediate prospects for deployment to them are bleak,” the FCC said in a report last year. “The costs of this broadband gap are measured in jobs not created, existing job openings not filled, and our nation’s competitiveness not advanced,” Genachowski said today. The proposals will be brought before the agency’s four commissioners at an Oct. 27 FCC meeting. Source of Money The FCC is seeking to transform the USF into a “Connect America Fund” designed to ensure affordable high-speed Internet service in regions that lack access and to promote mobile broadband nationwide. The Universal Service Fund supports phone service to schools, libraries, the poor and high-cost areas. The fund is financed by charges on long-distance calls paid by telephone subscribers, and it subsidizes companies including Windstream Corp. (WIN) and Frontier Communications Corp. (FTR)  In 2010, the program paid $4.3 billion to carriers doing business in high-cost areas, according to the website of the Universal Service Administrative Company , a Washington-based independent nonprofit group that administers the fund. More than 1,700 carriers receive support from the program for high-cost areas. Senator Jay Rockefeller , a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce committee, called for an Oct. 12 hearing to discuss the proposed reforms. Details of the plan announced today have not been released publicly by the FCC. High-Cost Subsidy Genachowski has singled out the subsidy program for high- cost regions as one possible source of money for broadband expansion. The agency voted in February to develop the USF overhaul, and since then has held workshops across the country. The FCC also plans to revamp the fees paid to rural carriers for connecting calls, Genachowski said. The changes would be phased in over several years, he said. Changes to so-called intercarrier connection fees “will result in significant consumer benefits,” Genachowski said. “Consumers can expect reduced costs, better value for their money, or both.” A coalition of telephone companies led by AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) in July asked the FCC to reduce those fees, which can amount to as much as $8 billion annually. Bob Quinn, AT&T’s senior vice president-federal regulatory, said the company was committed to working with the FCC on the changes to the Universal Service Fund and intercarrier compensation. Loitering Rules “Absent reform, these rules will simply loiter on to foster more litigation and arbitrage, and ultimately stifle innovation and the benefits of broadband for consumers,” Quinn said in an e-mail. The FCC’s push to overhaul the USF program may leave “mom and-pop” telephone providers behind, David Mitchell, director of the bureau of economic research at Missouri State University , said in an interview. Small phone companies would likely stop offering service and be unable to afford the investment needed to become broadband providers. Their absence in the market may mean that “the winners would be larger corporations,” as AT&T and Verizon take over those markets, he said. Rural telecommunications providers said they want to ensure that the FCC’s plan strengthens their networks. Common-Sense Reforms “We will continue to press for common-sense reforms that recognize the unique challenges faced by small carriers and the consumers they serve in rural areas across the country,” Shirley Bloomfield, chief executive officer of the National Telecommunications Cooperative Association , which represents more than 570 small phone providers nationwide, said in a statement. “The entities that all along face the greatest risk are the small rural” carriers, said Jeffrey Silva, senior policy director for telecommunications, media and technology at Medley Global Advisors in Washington. “Even though they face the risk, their inclusion is essential for at least politically, getting reforms through.” The plan outlined by Genachowski today left a number of questions unanswered, Art Brodsky, a spokesman for Washington- based advocacy group Public Knowledge , said in an e-mail. “There is still a big question mark whether the FCC has the authority to deal with broadband as the Chairman wants to do,” Brodsky said.

The International Monetary Fund forecasts economic growth for euro countries of 1.6 percent this year and 1.1 percent in 2012. Saft, based in the Paris suburb of Bagnolet, may benefit from the euro’s decline against the dollar as 40 percent of the company’s sales are in the U.S. currency, a greater proportion than its costs, Searle said. Saft also stands to gain from a recent drop in the price of nickel, for which at least 60 percent of needs are hedged six months in advance, the CEO said. Many of Saft’s activities tied to infrastructure are “late-cycle” businesses, Searle said. “If there is something bad coming in 2012, we wouldn’t expect to be one of the companies that would necessarily see that first.” Cash From Disposal Searle, who predicted in July that revenue in 2011 will rise at least 7 percent, is looking at options for using $145 million in cash the company got from selling its stake in a car- battery joint venture to Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI)  The French manufacturer must refinance about 330 million euros ($440 million) of bank loans due in July 2012 before potentially using the disposal’s proceeds for acquisitions or returning part of the money to shareholders, he said. Saft’s gross debt is about 3 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The net-debt ratio, which amounted to 1.24 times Ebitda in late 2010, may fall below 1 at the end of this year, Searle said. The best position may be “somewhere between” the net and gross figures, as Saft needs to fund sales growth of the lithium-ion batteries that it started making last month at a plant in Jacksonville, Florida , he said. Lithium-Ion Technology Lithium-ion technology will probably help Saft boost revenue by 10 percent a year from 2012 to 2016, helped by demand for metering systems installed by utilities and applications in renewable-energy storage and the aerospace industry , the company said in June. The manufacturer plans to reduce the cost of making these high-power batteries, which boast a faster recharge time and longer life cycle. Provided that the “ideal capital structure leaves us with an excess of cash” once the company has refinanced bank debt, one option would be to look at “ways to distribute some of that to our shareholders,” Searle said. The company needs to keep flexibility for “relatively modest” acquisitions in emerging markets to reduce the share of sales from Europe and the U.S., he said. Saft may also seek to buy some niche makers of specialized batteries, or some technology companies whose valuations “seem much more realistic” than a year ago, the CEO said.

The seven-member board, led by central bank President Julio Velarde, will keep the overnight rate at 4.25 percent today, according to 17 of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. One analyst predicts a 0.25-point cut to 4 percent. The board will announce its decision at about 7 p.m. New York time. The threat of stagnation in Europe and the U.S. has dimmed the outlook for Peru’s commodity-dependent economy and led the government to announce what it has called “preventive” stimulus measures. Though the central bank has indicated it will cut rates if global risks intensify and domestic activity slows, rising prices and stronger-than-expected domestic growth indicate there’s no need for laxer policy yet, said Juan Pablo Fuentes, a Latin America economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. “There’s a risk of a hard landing, so the government is preparing its tools for a negative scenario,” Fuentes said in a telephone interview from West Chester , Pennsylvania. “The central bank will be paying attention to the very fluid global situation and change its stance if necessary.” Stimulus, Sentiment The Andean nation is tapping its first fiscal surplus in three years to finance stimulus measures worth about $470 million as it seeks to reverse a decline in public infrastructure spending in the first half of this year. The stimulus will become more “aggressive” should a global slowdown cause exports and company spending to ease, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said Sept. 22. The International Monetary Fund on Sept. 20 cut its 2011 growth forecast for Peru to 6.2 percent from 6.6 percent previously. Growth will slow to 5.6 percent next year, the Washington-based lender said. The central bank’s latest survey shows companies are less optimistic about domestic demand and hiring prospects because the global outlook has darkened, said Carlos Durand, president of the Lima Chamber of Commerce, in a Sept. 27 interview. Investor caution on the global outlook and “political uncertainty” following Peru’s presidential election is affecting medium and long-term investment, Luis Castellanos, chief executive of Banco Internacional del Peru, told reporters Sept. 29. Demand for consumer loans remains “vigorous,” he said. Policy, Trade, Growth President Ollanta Humala on Oct. 3 confirmed Velarde’s appointment to serve a second five-year term, which Pedro Tuesta , a former Peruvian central bank analyst and current economist at 4Cast Inc. in Washington , said indicated policy continuity. Growth in retail and services helped offset a slowdown in manufacturing and construction in July and fuelled a 6.5 percent rise in gross domestic product, beating analysts’ and the central bank’s expectations. Cement demand rose for the first time in three months in August while electricity output climbed at the fastest annual pace in six months, which suggests growth is accelerating, Tuesta said. Peru’s trade surplus will probably fall to $4.3 billion next year from $7.4 billion this year because of lower copper, zinc, gold and silver prices, Velarde said Oct. 4. China ’s growth will remain “strong” this year and next, which “will guarantee that the price of exports will remain relatively high,” he said. Gross domestic product growth will slow to 5.7 percent in 2012 from 6.3 percent this year, the central bank chief said Sept. 16. Europe , Precautions Economic activity will slow in the next few months amid weaker construction and manufacturing output even though consumer demand remains “very strong” Velarde told congress Oct. 4. “In investment, there isn’t a lot of pessimism, but nor has there been such a strong recovery yet.” Investors “are waiting to see what will happen with the global outlook.” Policy makers will probably give more weight to the fall- out from Europe’s debt crisis, which led global stocks and commodity prices to tumble since their last meeting, said Roberto Melzi , at strategist at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York. “Risks to economic activity haven’t dissipated anywhere by any means,” said Melzi, who forecasts a 0.25-point rate cut today to be followed by similar cuts at the bank’s November and December meetings. “The global crisis is deepening.” Higher fuel costs pushed Peru’s consumer prices up 0.33 percent in September from 0.27 percent in August, driving the annual inflation rate to 3.73 percent, a two-year high. The central bank targets annual inflation in a range of 1 percent to 3 percent. Monthly inflation may slow to close to zero before year-end as some prices reverse recent increases, Velarde said Sept. 16. The annual inflation rate will converge toward the central bank’s target range next year, he said.

In the 2008-9 season taxes averaged 25.3 percent of international prices, the IMF said in a document posted on its website in November last year. While the country met the commitment in the season just ended, it had a change in government earlier this year. The rate meets a demand by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to reform the Ivorian cocoa and coffee industries in order to comply with the terms of its Heavily Indebted Poor Countries’ debt-relief program. Last year, the fixed duty on cocoa beans was scrapped and replaced with a levy that varies with prices as part of the reforms that will make the country eligible for $3 billion in debt relief from the Washington-based lenders. The document from the Abidjan-based ministry is dated Oct. 3 and applies to the 2011-12 harvest season, which began on Oct. 1. It was obtained by Bloomberg and hasn’t been publicly released. Norbert Komenan, an adviser to Finance Minister, Charles Koffi Diby, declined to comment when called today. The main export tax has been maintained at 14.6 percent. There are a number of other charges. Cocoa traded at $2,648 a metric ton in New York as of 11:03 a.m. local time. Disputed Election Discussions of the reform strategy with the World Bank are expected to resume in coming months, the IMF said on its website in July, two months after Alassane Ouattara was sworn in as president following a violent five-month political crisis that was sparked by a disputed November election. Cocoa and coffee exports were largely halted during that time, as Ouattara attempted to limit the flow of funds to Laurent Gbagbo , who refused to cede power despite losing the election. Businesses also shut their doors as customers stayed home and banks closed their branches amid the clashes. As many as 3,000 people were killed, according to the International Criminal Court , which is investigating crimes it says were committed by supporters of both leaders. Ivory Coast’s economy may contract 5.8 percent this year before expanding 8.5 percent in 2012, the ministry said last month.

Cutout values are separated into three main product types. Fabricated loads are beef cuts taken from an animal\\'s ribs, chuck, round, loin, brisket, short plate and flank; 50 percent loads are 50 percent lean beef trimmings. Ground loads may contain 73, 75, or 80 percent ground beef. A typical refrigerated truckload carries 40,000 pounds. Choice 1-3 grade is a better grade than Select 1-3, partly because Choice cuts have more fat, or marbling, than Select cuts. Grade quality is determined using a 1-5 yield grade scale. A rating of 1 is the highest ratio of muscle to fat, while 5 is the lowest.  Marbling is an important flavor factor.'

The three-year loan program is likely to come to the board of directors for approval in November, the Washington-based IMF said in an e-mailed statement today. The IMF has said its support was contingent on the country’s strengthening its financial system. “The authorities have made important progress on managing the Kabul Bank crisis that came to the fore in the fall of 2010,” IMF mission chief Axel Schimmelpfennig said in the statement. “The authorities’ program outlines further steps to strengthen and develop Afghanistan’s financial sector.” A loan would signal approval of Afghanistan’s policies, a condition for some governments that provide assistance. The IMF, which reached a similar agreement in July 2010 that never went to the board, had said Afghan authorities needed to prevent a repeat of the conditions that led to the collapse of Kabul Bank before obtaining aid. The government took over Kabul Bank, the country’s biggest commercial financial institution, in September 2010. Thousands of depositors rushed to withdraw their money last year after learning that the bank’s owners had lost hundreds of millions of dollars they had lent to themselves. Recovering Assets “Kabul Bank has been put into receivership, and efforts are under way to recover the embezzled assets from the former shareholders of the bank which will limit the fiscal costs of the crisis,” Schimmelpfennig said. “The central bank is also stepping up supervision and ensuring that the banking law and regulations are fully enforced.” Measures the Afghan government plans to take in exchange for the loan include introducing a value-added tax to make up for the expected decrease in revenue collection when the military withdraws. The IMF said it expects real economic growth of between 6 percent and 8 percent during the program period.

Traders pared bets today that the central bank will accelerate the pace of cuts after slashing the benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 12 percent on Aug. 31. The yield on the contract maturing in January 2013, the most traded in Sao Paulo today, rose 14 basis points to 10.36 percent at 5:01 p.m. New York time. Tombini’s use of the word “moderate” points to a rate cut of 50 basis points, rather than the 75 basis-point cut that some traders are betting on, said Andre Perfeito , an economist with Gradual Investimentos in Sao Paulo. Estado do S. Paulo reported Oct. 2 that President Dilma Rousseff wants the Selic rate to fall to 9 percent next year, citing three government officials that it didn’t identify. ‘Getting Worse’ “The bets on 75 basis points or even 100 basis points are driven by two main reasons: the belief that the situation in Europe is getting worse, and this talk about the monetary stance that Dilma Rousseff wanted next year,” Perfeito said. Consumer prices rose 7.33 percent in the year through mid- September, exceeding the 6.5 percent upper limit of the bank’s target range for a fifth straight month. Tombini pledged to slow inflation to 4.5 percent by the end of next year. Jankiel Santos , chief economist at Espirito Santo Investment Bank, said there is no case for speeding up the pace of rate cuts without evidence that the Brazilian economy is really being hit by the problems in Europe. Brazil’s economy showed clear signs of slowing in August and will grow 3.5 percent this year, Tombini said. Given slower domestic growth and the impact of the global crisis, policy makers decided to cut rates in August, he said. Brazil hasn’t abandoned its policy of accumulating foreign reserves, and the central bank will resume its dollar purchases when market conditions permit, Tombini said. He added that the central bank is ready to intervene in currency markets when movements in the real are not consistent with the dollar’s global trend. Brazil has $349 billion in international reserves, up 21 percent from the start of the year. The real appreciated 2.8 percent to 1.7811 per U.S. dollar.

(GE) and Ohio State University. “Middle-market businesses have a solid track record for performance through the recession,” GE and the university’s Fisher College of Business said in a report on the study. “Looking forward into 2012, 80 percent of middle-market companies expect to grow over the next 12 months.” Findings from the study, which included 2,028 executives from companies with annual sales of $10 million to $1 billion, were presented today at Ohio State’s Columbus campus during a summit attended by customers of the GE Capital finance unit. While mid-size firms’ payrolls fared better than those of large companies, which cut millions of jobs amid the worst slump since the Depression, the study also found challenges. About 55 percent of participants reported insufficient access to capital markets, 84 percent lacked confidence in the national economy and only 17 percent reported confidence in their local economies. Still, “this is a lot different than 2008,” GE Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt told reporters before the summit. “There’s liquidity, there are pockets of growth and I think people have confidence that they might be able to find the right pockets of growth.” “By their own self-assessment, the data strongly indicates that there is plenty of room to improve overall business performance,” the study found. Executives’ concerns include developing top leaders, attracting new customers and developing new products, according to the report. About 71 percent reported challenges dealing with regulations including tax law, and 45 percent are seeing challenges from global rivals, the survey said. International ‘Heat’ “While many middle-market companies have embraced global markets and are aggressively distributing their products and services in new geographies, many are also facing the heat from international competitors,” the study’s authors wrote. The U.S. has about 200,000 mid-size companies, accounting for about 3 percent of all the nation’s businesses, the study said, citing U.S. Census data. The firms offer 16 percent more jobs per dollar in assets than large companies and about 80 percent more jobs per dollar in revenue, the study indicated. Of the jobs they added from 2007 to 2010, about 500,000 were in the Midwest, a region where large companies eliminated 4.9 million workers. The unemployment rate in Ohio, the nation’s seventh most-populous state, was 9.1 percent in August, matching the U.S. rate. The state has lost 407,000 jobs, or 7.37 percent, during the past decade, federal data show. 20 Versus 2,0000 Nationwide, large companies cut a net 3.7 million jobs from 2007 to 2010, including firms that expanded employment, the GE survey showed. On average, middle-market companies added 20 jobs each, while their large counterparts cut 2,000, the survey said. GE Capital’s own review of about 1,200 middle-market customers and their fiscal health shows less-leveraged balance sheets and fewer paying down debt. That indicates companies may have arrived at a comfortable level of borrowing, Dan Henson, who oversees the Americas, said in an interview last week. “These companies are armored,” GE Capital CEO Mike Neal said today. “The environment may end up being bad, who knows, but at least in the United States companies are much better prepared for the most part, to deal with that.” The finance unit of Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE is among the largest lenders to middle-market companies.

            "Headline='FCC to Revamp Phone Subsidy to Spur Expanded Internet Access' Date='2011-10-06' Link='http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/fcc-to-revamp-phone-subsidy-to-spur-expanded-internet-access.html' Article='U.S. regulators proposed overhauling an $8 billion phone subsidy program for landline service to help fund a nationwide expansion of high-speed Internet. The changes to the program, known as the Universal Service Fund, will help increase access to broadband and spur job creation , Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski said during a speech today in Washington. The agency also plans to revise the fees that smaller regional carriers receive to connect calls, he said. “Broadband has gone from being a luxury to a necessity for full participation in our economy and society,” Genachowski said. “If we want the United States to be the world’s leading market” for innovation, “we need to embrace the essential goal of universal broadband, and reform outdated programs.” Under Genachowski, the FCC has sought to increase the share of people who use high-speed Internet at home to 90 percent from the current 65 percent, according to the agency’s national broadband plan. Between 14 million and 24 million Americans lack access to broadband, “and immediate prospects for deployment to them are bleak,” the FCC said in a report last year. “The costs of this broadband gap are measured in jobs not created, existing job openings not filled, and our nation’s competitiveness not advanced,” Genachowski said today. The proposals will be brought before the agency’s four commissioners at an Oct. 27 FCC meeting. Source of Money The FCC is seeking to transform the USF into a “Connect America Fund” designed to ensure affordable high-speed Internet service in regions that lack access and to promote mobile broadband nationwide. The Universal Service Fund supports phone service to schools, libraries, the poor and high-cost areas. The fund is financed by charges on long-distance calls paid by telephone subscribers, and it subsidizes companies including Windstream Corp. (WIN) and Frontier Communications Corp. (FTR)  In 2010, the program paid $4.3 billion to carriers doing business in high-cost areas, according to the website of the Universal Service Administrative Company , a Washington-based independent nonprofit group that administers the fund. More than 1,700 carriers receive support from the program for high-cost areas. Senator Jay Rockefeller , a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce committee, called for an Oct. 12 hearing to discuss the proposed reforms. Details of the plan announced today have not been released publicly by the FCC. High-Cost Subsidy Genachowski has singled out the subsidy program for high- cost regions as one possible source of money for broadband expansion. The agency voted in February to develop the USF overhaul, and since then has held workshops across the country. The FCC also plans to revamp the fees paid to rural carriers for connecting calls, Genachowski said. The changes would be phased in over several years, he said. Changes to so-called intercarrier connection fees “will result in significant consumer benefits,” Genachowski said. “Consumers can expect reduced costs, better value for their money, or both.” A coalition of telephone companies led by AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) in July asked the FCC to reduce those fees, which can amount to as much as $8 billion annually. Bob Quinn, AT&T’s senior vice president-federal regulatory, said the company was committed to working with the FCC on the changes to the Universal Service Fund and intercarrier compensation. Loitering Rules “Absent reform, these rules will simply loiter on to foster more litigation and arbitrage, and ultimately stifle innovation and the benefits of broadband for consumers,” Quinn said in an e-mail. The FCC’s push to overhaul the USF program may leave “mom and-pop” telephone providers behind, David Mitchell, director of the bureau of economic research at Missouri State University , said in an interview. Small phone companies would likely stop offering service and be unable to afford the investment needed to become broadband providers. Their absence in the market may mean that “the winners would be larger corporations,” as AT&T and Verizon take over those markets, he said. Rural telecommunications providers said they want to ensure that the FCC’s plan strengthens their networks. Common-Sense Reforms “We will continue to press for common-sense reforms that recognize the unique challenges faced by small carriers and the consumers they serve in rural areas across the country,” Shirley Bloomfield, chief executive officer of the National Telecommunications Cooperative Association , which represents more than 570 small phone providers nationwide, said in a statement. “The entities that all along face the greatest risk are the small rural” carriers, said Jeffrey Silva, senior policy director for telecommunications, media and technology at Medley Global Advisors in Washington. “Even though they face the risk, their inclusion is essential for at least politically, getting reforms through.” The plan outlined by Genachowski today left a number of questions unanswered, Art Brodsky, a spokesman for Washington- based advocacy group Public Knowledge , said in an e-mail. “There is still a big question mark whether the FCC has the authority to deal with broadband as the Chairman wants to do,” Brodsky said.

The seven-member board, led by central bank President Julio Velarde, will keep the overnight rate at 4.25 percent today, according to 17 of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. One analyst predicts a 0.25-point cut to 4 percent. The board will announce its decision at about 7 p.m. New York time. The threat of stagnation in Europe and the U.S. has dimmed the outlook for Peru’s commodity-dependent economy and led the government to announce what it has called “preventive” stimulus measures. Though the central bank has indicated it will cut rates if global risks intensify and domestic activity slows, rising prices and stronger-than-expected domestic growth indicate there’s no need for laxer policy yet, said Juan Pablo Fuentes, a Latin America economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. “There’s a risk of a hard landing, so the government is preparing its tools for a negative scenario,” Fuentes said in a telephone interview from West Chester , Pennsylvania. “The central bank will be paying attention to the very fluid global situation and change its stance if necessary.” Stimulus, Sentiment The Andean nation is tapping its first fiscal surplus in three years to finance stimulus measures worth about $470 million as it seeks to reverse a decline in public infrastructure spending in the first half of this year. The stimulus will become more “aggressive” should a global slowdown cause exports and company spending to ease, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said Sept. 22. The International Monetary Fund on Sept. 20 cut its 2011 growth forecast for Peru to 6.2 percent from 6.6 percent previously. Growth will slow to 5.6 percent next year, the Washington-based lender said. The central bank’s latest survey shows companies are less optimistic about domestic demand and hiring prospects because the global outlook has darkened, said Carlos Durand, president of the Lima Chamber of Commerce, in a Sept. 27 interview. Investor caution on the global outlook and “political uncertainty” following Peru’s presidential election is affecting medium and long-term investment, Luis Castellanos, chief executive of Banco Internacional del Peru, told reporters Sept. 29. Demand for consumer loans remains “vigorous,” he said. Policy, Trade, Growth President Ollanta Humala on Oct. 3 confirmed Velarde’s appointment to serve a second five-year term, which Pedro Tuesta , a former Peruvian central bank analyst and current economist at 4Cast Inc. in Washington , said indicated policy continuity. Growth in retail and services helped offset a slowdown in manufacturing and construction in July and fuelled a 6.5 percent rise in gross domestic product, beating analysts’ and the central bank’s expectations. Cement demand rose for the first time in three months in August while electricity output climbed at the fastest annual pace in six months, which suggests growth is accelerating, Tuesta said. Peru’s trade surplus will probably fall to $4.3 billion next year from $7.4 billion this year because of lower copper, zinc, gold and silver prices, Velarde said Oct. 4. China ’s growth will remain “strong” this year and next, which “will guarantee that the price of exports will remain relatively high,” he said. Gross domestic product growth will slow to 5.7 percent in 2012 from 6.3 percent this year, the central bank chief said Sept. 16. Europe , Precautions Economic activity will slow in the next few months amid weaker construction and manufacturing output even though consumer demand remains “very strong” Velarde told congress Oct. 4. “In investment, there isn’t a lot of pessimism, but nor has there been such a strong recovery yet.” Investors “are waiting to see what will happen with the global outlook.” Policy makers will probably give more weight to the fall- out from Europe’s debt crisis, which led global stocks and commodity prices to tumble since their last meeting, said Roberto Melzi , at strategist at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York. “Risks to economic activity haven’t dissipated anywhere by any means,” said Melzi, who forecasts a 0.25-point rate cut today to be followed by similar cuts at the bank’s November and December meetings. “The global crisis is deepening.” Higher fuel costs pushed Peru’s consumer prices up 0.33 percent in September from 0.27 percent in August, driving the annual inflation rate to 3.73 percent, a two-year high. The central bank targets annual inflation in a range of 1 percent to 3 percent. Monthly inflation may slow to close to zero before year-end as some prices reverse recent increases, Velarde said Sept. 16. The annual inflation rate will converge toward the central bank’s target range next year, he said. Peru’s sol posted the steepest quarterly decline since 2008 in the July-through-September period as copper prices fell and concern about slowing world growth wiped $10 trillion from global equities.

Hundt, who was chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission from 1993 to 1997, is working with the government as well as Silicon Valley venture capital and private equity firms to ensure that money is still available for clean-energy projects after the collapse of Solyndra LLC last month. “Step one is that the Silicon Valley venture community has to stand up for the fundamental idea that success can come from failure,” Hundt said in an interview at a clean-tech conference yesterday in Redwood City, California. “And this is a Congress that hates taxes, so how about eliminating all income tax on the sale of clean-energy goods or services for the next decade.” Solyndra, a solar-panel maker in Fremont, California , fired 1,100 workers and filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 6, two years after receiving a $535 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy. The company’s downfall doesn’t change the need for the production of biofuels, solar power and technology that helps reduce energy consumption, Hundt said. State Initiatives In addition to making proposals to Congress, Hundt’s Washington-based nonprofit is working with individual states to make capital more available. In June, Connecticut adopted a measure for a so-called green bank, designed to provide low-cost financing for energy-efficiency projects. The project will be funded by a surcharge on residential and commercial electric bills amounting to about $30 million a year. Legislators in Oregon , Michigan , Pennsylvania , Ohio and New York have reached out to Hundt’s coalition to do something similar, he said. Venture funding of clean-tech companies fell 4.5 percent in the first half of this year to $2.17 billion from $2.27 billion a year earlier, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Still, the $1.23 billion invested in the first quarter marked the second-highest period ever, after the second quarter of 2010, the NVCA said. That won’t slow down just because Solyndra is being scrutinized, said Jim Fulton, co-chair of the clean energy and technologies group at law firm Cooley LLP in Palo Alto, California, which sponsored the conference. Congressional Republicans are leading an investigation into Solyndra’s loan guarantee, and the company faces a probe by the FBI. “Solyndra will not be a defining moment in clean-tech history,” Fulton said in an interview. “There is an alternative universe in Washington , D.C., and politics that is blowing this out of proportion.” Hundt, 63, also works with the Aspen Institute , which describes itself as a “venue for discussing and acting on critical issues,” and worked on President Barack Obama’s transition team from 2008 to 2009. He serves on the board of Intel Corp.

Sterling dropped against all but two of its 16 major counterparts, sliding most versus the Australian dollar. The Monetary Policy Committee will leave its key rate unchanged at 0.5 percent, according to all 53 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Eleven of 32 economists surveyed separately predict at least a 50 billion-pound ($77 billion) increase in its so- called quantitative easing program. “There might be a short relief rally in sterling on a lack of further BOE action but it’s likely to be short-lived as the market is still focused on the likelihood of further QE by the November meeting,” said Ian Stannard , London-based head of European currency strategy at Morgan Stanley. “The BOE will move towards further QE in coming months and ultimately sterling will come under pressure.” The pound weakened 0.1 percent to $1.5439 at 8:54 a.m. in London. It declined 0.2 percent to 118.47 yen and was little changed against the euro at 86.36 pence. Morgan Stanley recommends selling the pound on any “relief rallies” that are likely to occur should the central bank refrain from announcing further monetary stimulus for the U.K. economy. The Bank of England has faced pressure to embark on further quantitative easing to help revive an economy battling the steepest government spending cuts since World War II and a worsening euro-area debt crisis. The U.K.’s economy grew less than expected in the second quarter, expanding 0.1 percent from the first three months of the year, the Office for National Statistics said yesterday. That was lower than the 0.2 percent previously published by the statistics body and also missed the 0.2 percent expansion forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. U.K. 10-year gilt yields were three basis points lower at 2.34 percent and the two-year note yield was little changed at 0.58 percent.

The project then stalled because of a lack of funds and a dispute over new costs caused by the delay. Rosatom gave a new cost estimate of 6.3 billion euros, while Bulgaria said the construction would cost about 5 billion euros. Last month, the two companies agreed to extend an accord to March next year on the building of the proposed 2,000-megawatt nuclear power plant, to give them time to complete a feasibility study and consider ways of financing the project. “We can’t take decisions to spend such huge amounts with our eyes closed,” Energy and Economy Minister Traicho Traikov said today in an interview with Bulgarian National Television in Sofia. “We need to know the cost of investment, power market development prospects, estimated electricity prices.” To contact the reporter responsible for this story: Elizabeth Konstantinova at  ekonstantino@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story:' Industry='Energy' KeyPoints='- Bulgaria filed a 61 million-euro arbitration claim against Rosatom for unpaid purchases of old equipment for the Danube nuclear plant.\\n- Atomstroyexport ZAO, Rosatom’s unit, filed a 58 million-euro claim against Bulgaria at the International Court of Arbitration in Paris for delayed payments.\\n- Atomstroyexport was hired in 2005 to build the plant for an initial cost estimate of 4 billion euros.\\n- The project stalled due to funding shortages and disputes over new costs caused by delays, with Rosatom valuing the project at about 6.3 billion euros and Bulgaria at roughly 5 billion euros.\\n- The parties extended an accord to March next year to continue negotiations, complete a feasibility study, and consider financing options.'\n",

The company has $2.5 billion invested in farmland and owns about 600,000 hectares (1.48 million acres) mostly in the U.S., Brazil and Australia, said Jose Minaya, 40, a managing director and head of natural resources and infrastructure investments at New York-based TIAA-CREF. “From a historical point of view, farmland has generated returns of 8 percent to 12 percent a year and we expect that to continue over the long term,” Minaya said. Farms are attracting investors such as billionaire George Soros as rising incomes in China and India and a growing world population increase demand for food and fuel. Food production will have to climb 70 percent by 2050 as the population rises to 9.2 billion from 6.9 billion in 2010, according to the United Nations. Global food costs reached a record in February after weather ruined crops from Canada to Australia and Russia. The Standard & Poor’s Spot Index of 24 commodities has dropped 21 percent from its April high on concern the European debt crisis would slow growth and curb demand. The gauge had more than doubled since the start of 2009. The MSCI All-Country World Index of global equities lost 22 percent from its May high. ‘Pretty Steady’ Farmland is an asset class that’s “pretty steady” and delivers stable income returns with capital appreciation that tracks slightly above inflation, said Minaya, who previously worked for AIG Global Investment Group and Merrill Lynch & Co. The company is seeking to expand in grain-exporting countries and hold investments for as long as 30 years, he said in an interview Sept. 30. “We can easily be twice the size that we are today” if the right opportunities arise, he said. The pension manager buys land and leases it back to farmers, he said. The investments are in “mature and established” regions, in “the bigger farms” and in countries that export grain, he said. Returns in the past few years have been at the high end of the 8 percent to 12 percent range, he said Sept. 30. “On aggregate, it does look like a pretty good bet,” said Michael Creed , an agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. “We’re entering a period of rapid growth in emerging- market demand for higher protein,” which is increasing use of grains to feed poultry and livestock, he said from Melbourne. Farmland Values TIAA-CREF is one of eight institutional investors representing $1.3 trillion in assets that have endorsed a set of Farmland Principles ranging from environmental sustainability to transparency and respect for land rights, it said on Sept. 6. Farmland values in one of the most-productive regions in the U.S. Midwest soared 17 percent in the second quarter as higher grain prices made real estate more attractive, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said on Aug. 17. The increase from a year ago in the area including Illinois , Indiana , Iowa and Wisconsin was the biggest since the 1970s, it said. A fund controlled by George Soros owns 23 percent of South American farmland venture Adecoagro SA, Bloomberg data show. The company is involved in the production of grains, oilseeds, dairy, sugar, ethanol, coffee, cotton and cattle meat, and has operations in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, its website said. Shrinking land and water supply in countries including China and India, will limit their capacity to boost food production, creating import demand, Minaya said. That’s going to be met by the major exporting regions in North and South America, Australia, and parts of Central and Eastern Europe, he said. As well as the U.S., Australia and Brazil, the company has a smaller level of investments in Poland and Romania , he said.

Aronson, 43, lured about 140 people to buy promissory notes from companies he controlled including PermaPave Industries LLC, touting returns of up to 33 percent on investments in natural- stone pavers imported from Australia , the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a complaint filed today in Manhattan. U.S. attorneys filed related criminal charges against Aronson today, the SEC said. Aronson and other executives used new investor funds collected between 2006 and 2010 to make payments to earlier customers and siphoned off money to buy themselves luxury cars, jewelry and gambling trips to Las Vegas , according to the complaint. Aronson, who penned the 2007 book “DASH” with a first chapter entitled “The Buffet of Life,” misappropriated about $2.6 million through two other companies he solely controlled, using the money to pay back victims of a scheme to which he pleaded guilty in 2000, the SEC said. Randy Zelin, an attorney for Aronson and PermaPave , declined immediate comment. Aronson and his associates “created the facade of a profitable business, promised investors extraordinary rates of return, and used much of their investors’ money to fund their own lavish lifestyle,” George Canellos, head of the SEC’s New York office, said in a statement.

Protection on $10 million of securities for 10 years cost as much as $245,000 this week, according to London-based data provider CMA. That’s the most since Jan. 7, three weeks after banking analyst Meredith Whitney predicted “hundreds of billions of dollars” of defaults in the coming year. Instead, failures plunged to $1.1 billion, a quarter of 2010’s rate, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Prices of privately traded credit-default swap contracts have risen 78 percent since May 31 even after states closed a projected $32 billion in budget deficits, according to the Washington-based National Conference of State Legislatures. States and localities have also recorded seven straight quarters of year-over-year revenue growth, the U.S. Census Bureau said, while enjoying the longest stretch of rising income and falling interest rates since Bill Clinton ’s presidency. While states and cities are balancing budgets and slashing borrowing costs, investors are buying hedges against defaults on concern about a slowing global economy, said Peter Demirali, who manages $350 million of municipal debt at Cumberland Advisors in Mendham Township, New Jersey. “Revenues are increasing,” Demirali said in a telephone interview. “They’re laying off workers and restructuring health and pension benefits. So the risk isn’t really any higher, it’s just that risk around the globe has moved higher.” Economies Slow U.S. gross domestic product growth may slow to 1.6 percent this year from 3 percent in 2010, while Europe ’s expansion rate may cool to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. A credit-default insurance contract based on the Markit MCDX credit-default swaps index reached a record of 340 basis points in December 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings. While CDS prices were rising, yields on municipal bonds had already begun plummeting to the lowest levels in at least six years, according to Bloomberg Fair Value data. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Prices of the privately traded contracts next peaked on June 30, 2010, two weeks after 10-year muni yields began a 29 percent drop lasting through early September. The 2011 high for the CDS index was in January after Whitney’s appearance on CBS’s “60 Minutes” on Dec. 19. By mid-February, municipal debt had started an eight-month rally that pushed interest rates to the lowest levels since 1967, when Lyndon B. Johnson was president. Default Drop About 64 percent of municipal bankers, advisers and government officials expect the number of defaults to drop or remain the same this year compared with 2010, according to an RBC Capital Markets survey conducted at a Bond Buyer conference in Carlsbad, California last month. Credit-default swap costs may not be a precise gauge of risk, said Tom Dresslar , a spokesman for California Treasurer Bill Lockyer. The biggest borrower in the $2.9 trillion municipal market saw the price of protecting its debt for 10 years jump to 286 basis points yesterday from 247 basis points on Sept. 29, according to data from CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. “Anyone who tried to divine the reasons for movement in municipal CDS prices is on a fool’s errand,” Dresslar said in an e-mail. “There is no rhyme or reason. That’s probably because the entire market has no basis in reality.” Ratio Increase The rise in credit default swaps has accompanied an increase in the ratio of 10-year municipal yields to similarly maturing U.S. government-bond rates. The yields on tax-exempt debt have been at or above 100 percent of Treasuries for five straight weeks, the longest stretch since May 2009, according to Bloomberg data. Still, investors in September added $1.9 billion to tax- exempt funds, the biggest monthly inflow since September 2010 when buyers added $2.6 billion, according to Lipper US Fund Flows. States and cities are set to issue $75 billion in the last three months of 2010, up from an earlier projection of $60 million, as issuers take advantage of plunging interest rates , Chris Mauro, a municipal-debt investment strategist for RBC Capital Markets in New York wrote in a report last month. Yields on 10-year top-rated municipals were 2.36 percent yesterday, after falling to 2.13 percent on Sept. 27, the lowest level since March 1991, when Bloomberg data for the securities begins. Following are descriptions of pending sales of municipal debt: The STATE OF WASHINGTON plans to borrow $1.29 billion in general-obligation bonds as soon as Oct. 10 with $516.7 million of the transaction in new money to help fund the Floating Bridge and Eastside Project.

Tokyo-based Orix may buy an investment management firm or take over a team of fund managers and research staff in the U.S. to start investing in stocks, Deputy President Haruyuki Urata said in an interview in Tokyo on Oct. 3. The company has been in talks with “several firms,” he said, declining to name potential targets or say how much Orix would spend. The financial company aims to boost its asset-management operations in the U.S. and Asia by adding equity-related investment products to its fixed-income portfolio. The firm acquired stakes last year in a U.S. hedge fund manager that invests mainly in debt, and a Vietnamese investment company. “We want to diversify our products and client network by expanding into equity investments and attracting Asian investors,” said Urata, 56, who is also chief financial officer. “It’s crucial to show our stakeholders that we are always challenging ourselves and eying new things.” Shares of Orix, which got about 14 percent of its revenue from the Americas last fiscal year, have fallen 26 percent this year, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average shed 17 percent. The shares rose 3.3 percent to 5,880 yen today. Good Timing “The U.S. market is the most important for the asset management business in terms of size and potential,” said Yoku Ihara, an investment adviser at Retela Crea Securities Co. in Tokyo. “It’s positive to see the firm is aggressively trying an acquisition and it’s good timing because of the yen’s appreciation.” Overseas investors account for 52 percent of the company’s shareholders. The yen has climbed 12 percent against the dollar in the past six months, the only one of 16 major currencies to advance. Orix purchased 25 percent of Ho Chi Minh City-based Indochina Capital Corp. , which operates real estate funds with $500 million under management, in November. It also acquired in December a majority holding in Harrison, New York-based Mariner Investment Group LLC, which manages about $11.7 billion. The firm aims to double assets under Mariner Investment within five years to more than $20 billion, Orix USA Corp. President James Thompson said in an interview in October 2010. Orix, formed in 1964, has about 18,000 employees and 883 subsidiaries and affiliates in more than 25 countries, according to its website. The company posted a 44 percent gain in profit for the three months ended June to 23.7 billion yen ($309 million), driven by investment banking and overseas businesses. Orix also plans to add new markets for its financing, and will sell 400 million yuan ($63 million) of bonds by March 31 in Hong Kong , while considering raising funds in Australia , Thailand , South Korea , Singapore and Malaysia, said Urata.

Baum’s foreclosure law firm , one of the largest in New York state, will pay the U.S. $2 million and change its practices, including those related to Merscorp Inc.’s mortgage database, to resolve a probe of its foreclosure filings. The agreement, signed today, resolves an investigation into whether the Baum firm filed misleading pleadings, affidavits and mortgage assignments in courts, according to a statement by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan. The settlement doesn’t constitute a finding of wrongdoing. “There are no excuses for sloppy practices that could lead to someone mistakenly losing their home,” Bharara said in the statement. “Homeowners facing foreclosure cannot afford to have faulty paperwork or inadequate evidence submitted, and today’s agreement will help minimize that risk.” Steven J. Baum PC, located in Amherst, New York, just north of Buffalo, has attracted lawsuits and fines for its actions during the housing crisis. It has been accused of overcharging, filing false documents and representing parties on both sides of a mortgage transfer. State attorneys general and federal regulators are negotiating with banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) to try to reach a settlement over faulty foreclosure practices in the wake of the financial crisis. The changes in procedure “go over and above what current law requires,” Baum said in an e-mailed statement. “We will continue to adhere to the highest ethical standards.” Shares Address Pillar Processing LLC, which processes foreclosure documents and shares an address with the law firm, is also part of the settlement. Pillar is owned by Manhattan private-equity firm Tailwind Capital LLC, according to its website. Brooke Gordon, spokeswoman for Tailwind Capital, declined to comment on the settlement. Baum acknowledged that the firm “occasionally made inadvertent errors in its legal filings in state and federal court, which it attributes to human error in light of the high volume of mortgage defaults and foreclosures,” according to Bharara’s statement. The agreement calls for the firm’s employees to halt their practice of assigning mortgages as supposed employees of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems Inc., an electronic database of mortgages. ‘No Connection’ “Until recently, employees of Baum, with the consent of MERS, had been assigning mortgages on behalf of MERS, even though they had no connection to MERS whatsoever,” according to Bharara’s statement. MERS, a unit of Reston, Virginia-based Merscorp Inc., was set up by the mortgage industry to allow banks to assign and reassign home loans without having to record the changes with county land-records offices. Janis Smith, a MERS spokeswoman, didn’t have an immediate comment on the MERS allegation. The agreement calls for the Baum firm to obtain affidavits from clients attesting that they have the original promissory notes or have searched for them, to have experienced attorneys supervise the preparation of documents and to implement a training program for its attorneys. MERS Assignments “Borrowers and some courts have been questioning the validity of MERS assignments, pleadings and affidavits from the Baum firm for several years,” Jennifer Sinton, deputy director of the foreclosure-prevention project at South Brooklyn Legal Services, said in an interview. “It’s good to see that Baum is now required to discontinue these practices. Hopefully, this will protect courts and homeowners from bogus foreclosure lawsuits.” New York State Supreme Court Justice Arthur M. Schack in Brooklyn called the Baum firm’s explanations in one case “so incredible, outrageous, ludicrous and disingenuous that they should have been authored by the late Rod Serling.” Schack threw out the case in part because he said the assignment of the loan by a Baum lawyer on behalf of MERS as nominee of the lender had been done improperly. The same day, the Baum firm represented the buyer of the loan by filing the foreclosure action, the judge said. Schack said it was a conflict for the firm to represent both sides. “Steven J. Baum PC appears to be operating in a parallel mortgage universe, unrelated to the real universe,” the judge wrote in that May 2010 decision. “Next stop, the Twilight Zone,” he said, quoting from Serling’s TV series about science fiction and the supernatural. Baum said last year that in several cases where Schack stated the firm represented both sides in a mortgage transfer, “we have supplied to the court relevant documentation indicating that no conflict of interest existed.” To contact the reporter on this story: Thom Weidlich in Brooklyn , New York, federal court at  tweidlich@bloomberg.net.

Some 16,000 workers spread between Hamburg, where Airbus assembles single-aisle planes, and Bremen, Stade, and Buxtehude, where plane structures are built, have been asked to leave their work stations and gather for rallies, the IG Metall union said in a statement today. Workers and management have been tussling over new contracts that will run through 2020. Management has already agreed to offer job guarantees and is seeking 8 percent productivity increases. Workers say that’s too much and are offering 2 percent productivity gains instead. “Both sides agree that we need to make productivity increases, and management is waiting for them to come back to the table. It’s important to reach a conclusion,” said Florian Seidel, a spokesman for Airbus in Hamburg. Seidel said Airbus doesn’t expect the work actions to last more than an hour or two and said management is eager to resolve differences quickly. Management and labor have different methods of calculating the productivity increases, Seidel said. The strike is planned to stretch over three shifts at the four production centers tomorrow, said Heiko Messerschmidt, a spokesman for the IG Metall labor union for the coastal region, who spoke by telephone from Hamburg. He predicted “several thousand” workers will show up at rallies. “We hope that these actions will put enough pressure on Airbus to return to the negotiation table,” said Messerschmidt. “We know that flexibility is a requirement, but not at any price.” In Germany workers are required to give notice before staging any strike action. Airbus had gone to court in September to block any such action, a bid that was thrown out.

            "Headline='Saft Chief Says Infrastructure So Far Proving Resilient to Debt' Date='2011-10-06' Link='http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/saft-chief-says-infrastructure-so-far-proving-resilient-to-debt.html' Article='Saft Groupe SA (SAFT) , a French maker of batteries for aerospace, railway and telecommunications uses, said Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis hasn’t reduced sales as slowing economies hurt its customers later than other companies. “We don’t think we’ve seen anything notable in terms of change in the third quarter,” Chief Executive Officer John Searle said in an interview in Paris yesterday. “It would seem that the financial market pessimism hasn’t yet hit the real economy.” Moody’s Investors Service cut Italy ’s credit rating by three levels on Oct. 4, and said it may lower those of some other European countries, citing potential for a “profound loss” in investor confidence stemming from the debt crisis. The International Monetary Fund forecasts economic growth for euro countries of 1.6 percent this year and 1.1 percent in 2012. Saft, based in the Paris suburb of Bagnolet, may benefit from the euro’s decline against the dollar as 40 percent of the company’s sales are in the U.S. currency, a greater proportion than its costs, Searle said. Saft also stands to gain from a recent drop in the price of nickel, for which at least 60 percent of needs are hedged six months in advance, the CEO said. Many of Saft’s activities tied to infrastructure are “late-cycle” businesses, Searle said. “If there is something bad coming in 2012, we wouldn’t expect to be one of the companies that would necessarily see that first.” Cash From Disposal Searle, who predicted in July that revenue in 2011 will rise at least 7 percent, is looking at options for using $145 million in cash the company got from selling its stake in a car- battery joint venture to Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI)  The French manufacturer must refinance about 330 million euros ($440 million) of bank loans due in July 2012 before potentially using the disposal’s proceeds for acquisitions or returning part of the money to shareholders, he said. Saft’s gross debt is about 3 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The net-debt ratio, which amounted to 1.24 times Ebitda in late 2010, may fall below 1 at the end of this year, Searle said. The best position may be “somewhere between” the net and gross figures, as Saft needs to fund sales growth of the lithium-ion batteries that it started making last month at a plant in Jacksonville, Florida , he said. Lithium-Ion Technology Lithium-ion technology will probably help Saft boost revenue by 10 percent a year from 2012 to 2016, helped by demand for metering systems installed by utilities and applications in renewable-energy storage and the aerospace industry , the company said in June. The manufacturer plans to reduce the cost of making these high-power batteries, which boast a faster recharge time and longer life cycle. Provided that the “ideal capital structure leaves us with an excess of cash” once the company has refinanced bank debt, one option would be to look at “ways to distribute some of that to our shareholders,” Searle said. The company needs to keep flexibility for “relatively modest” acquisitions in emerging markets to reduce the share of sales from Europe and the U.S., he said. Saft may also seek to buy some niche makers of specialized batteries, or some technology companies whose valuations “seem much more realistic” than a year ago, the CEO said.

(AAPL) fans worldwide mourned the death of co-founder Steve Jobs , paying tribute to the man who changed the way they listen to music, use their mobile phones and play on their computers. At Apple’s headquarters -- located at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California -- flags flew at half-staff and bagpipes sounded to the tune of “Amazing Grace” as people placed flowers around a white iPad with a picture of Jobs, who died yesterday at 56, after a battle with cancer. Mourners flocked to Apple stores from New York to Hong Kong , while a crowd gathered in San Francisco ’s Mission Dolores Park for an iPhone-lit vigil. “Part of the narrative that made Apple what it is today goes out with Steve Jobs,” said Christopher Smith, 40, a former business development manager in San Francisco who joined the vigil. “I came out to honor the fact that one man with vision, courage and unwavering dedication can still change the world. The way that I communicate and the way that I interact with the world is through things that Steve Jobs has created.” Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates and Sony Corp. (6758) Chairman Howard Stringer were among leaders who expressed admiration for the man who built the world’s most valuable technology company. President Barack Obama and former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair also issued statements of sympathy. Jobs’s Home “Michelle and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Steve Jobs,” Obama said in a statement. “Steve was among the greatest of American innovators -- brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it.” While Apple plans a celebration for staff, it doesn’t intend to hold a public ceremony, a person familiar with the matter said. Teary-eyed mourners left flowers in front of Jobs’s modest home at the corner of Waverly Street and Santa Rita Avenue in Palo Alto , California. Neighborhood children drew hearts with markers and left them on the ground for others to leave messages. Policemen stood watch, barricading the street. “Here’s a guy who’s a billionaire and lives in a regular neighborhood, not behind a gated estate with all the security guards,” said Bruce Gee, a former Apple employee who drove up to the house from his home a couple miles away. “On Halloween, people go trick or treating there like everyone else.” At the San Francisco Apple store near Union Square, Steve Streza, 24, stood holding an iPad displaying Apple’s homepage image of Jobs and the words “Steve Jobs: 1955-2011.” ‘Regular Guy’ “Macs were the reason I got into product development,” said Streza, a developer at readitlater.com who grew up with Mac computers. “If it weren’t for Steve Jobs and Macs, my life would probably be in a completely different place right now.” Steve Somerstein, who says he met Jobs several times since 1986, recalled the time when he bumped into Jobs while apartment hunting in Palo Alto. “He was just a regular guy,” said Somerstein, who was at the Palo Alto store. “I congratulated him on the company and hoped it was going to do well. I didn’t even own an Apple at that point. He was about 10 years younger than me and just a nice kid.” Ron Kent, a food-truck owner who was at the Palo Alto store, likened Jobs to Michelangelo, the renaissance-era artist who painted the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. “He’s the visionary of our time,” Kent said. ‘RIP Steve Jobs’ Some mourned via social media sites. More than 20 “RIP Steve Jobs” pages sprung up on Facebook within hours of the announced passing of Jobs. News of Jobs’s death slowed the mobile websites of CNN and the Washington Post, according to Keynote Systems Inc. (KEYN) , which tracks website performance. “Steve Jobs,” the biography written by former Time magazine editor Walter Isaacson, scheduled for release Nov. 21, was the best seller on Amazon.com Inc.’s website. In New York, Jared and Alexi Roth, 33 and 31, left two red apples by the wall outside the Apple store on Broadway in the Upper West Side. “We were literally walking by a market on Broadway when Jared got a text saying Steve Jobs died,” Alexi said. “We saw the apples and just thought it would be appropriate.” Across the ocean, Charanis Chiu, walked in front of the Apple store in Hong Kong to place a sunflower, the logo of the photo-viewing application on the iPhone. “A lot of companies such as Microsoft and Nokia are following in his direction,” said Chiu, a vendor of photographic equipment. “Apple will continue to grow as long as they are going in the right direction.” ‘Insanely Great Honor’ At the store in Shanghai ’s Lujiazui district, an area of about three square meters was set aside at the front for people to pay tribute to Jobs. Microsoft’s Gates praised the man who for decades was both a rival and a partner in the personal-computer industry. “The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come,” Gates said. “For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it’s been an insanely great honor.\\xa0I will miss Steve immensely.” Stephen Elop, chief executive officer of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , said the world lost a “true visionary” in Jobs’s passing. Sachio Kitagawa, 45, was on her way with her son to the Apple store in the Ginza shopping district of Tokyo when she heard the news of Jobs’s passing. “He should receive the Nobel prize,” said Kitagawa, who’s used Apple products for 20 years. “I have a second child who is disabled and even he can use the Macintosh. It shows you how user-friendly Apple products are.” ‘Thank You’ Outside the Apple store a short walk from Frankfurt ’s financial institutions, sunflowers, gerbera daisies and roses were laid alongside a burning candle. “He forged designs which appealed to the mass market and developed technology which you can now find in museums -- not because of its age, but because it was groundbreaking,” said Guenther Uttecht, a 60-year-old artist who uses Apple products to work on abstract photos as he left the shop. At the entrance of the store on Regents Street in London lay a white rose with a hand-written note saying “Rip Steve Jobs. With love from Instagramers London and all Instagramers around the world. You gave us life. Thank you x”. Next to it a passerby had left an apple with a bite out of it, imitating the brand’s iconic logo, alongside a bouquet of lillies. On Rue Halevy, just behind Opera Garnier in central Paris, flowers were tucked into the doors of the Apple store. One bouquet had a card from Mario Baluci, the creative artist at Carre Senart, that said, “Thank you, Steve.” In Singapore , Georgina Koh, 30, recalled the man who inspired her to open her own accessory shop. “The world should remember Steve Jobs’s famous quote ‘Stay Hungry, Stay foolish,’” said Koh, a former Apple worker, in reference to Jobs’s Stanford University commencement speech in 2005. “It’s an honor to have been associated with Apple. It is a company built by a man relentless about creating beautiful products that have changed our lives.” To contact the reporters on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at  dbass2@bloomberg.net ; Douglas Macmillan in New York at  dmacmillan3@bloomberg.net ; Danielle Kucera in New York at  dkucera6@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at  tgiles5@bloomberg.net' Industry='Information Technology' KeyPoints=\"- Steve Jobs died at 56 after a battle with cancer, prompting a worldwide wave of mourning among Apple fans.\\n- Observances at Apple stores and headquarters included half-staff flags, flowers around a white iPad with Jobs' image, and vigils from New York to Hong Kong.\\n- Prominent figures paid tribute, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Nokia's Stephen Elop, with President Barack Obama also issuing a sympathetic statement.\\n- The public and media reaction included social-media tributes and interest around Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs biography, which topped Amazon's best-seller list.\\n- Apple planned an internal staff celebration and did not announce a public memorial, underscoring Jobs' legacy as a visionary who helped reshape technology.\"\n",

Prices for some of Ireland’s trophy homes fell at least as much as the rest of the country’s slumping market after the real-estate collapse drained the fortunes of property-boom millionaires. Thorndene, another house on Shrewsbury Road in Dublin’s Ballsbridge, is on the market for 8 million euros, down from an asking price of 14 million euros in 2009. Prime property prices rose faster than the rest of the market during Ireland’s boom “because there was a lot of people chasing too few properties, which gave them a spike,” said Wade Wise of Beirne & Wise, who has been selling Irish high -end homes for 12 years. “Come the crash, they’ve fallen further.” In property markets including London and Paris, luxury home prices fell less following the financial crisis and recovered more quickly than the broader market on tight supply and investment from abroad. Prices in London neighborhoods such as Knightsbridge and St. John’s Wood exceed their pre-recession peaks. Worse Than Average While prices in Dublin have fallen more than 50 percent on average, top end values are down about 75 percent, Wise said. “The drivers of the bubble, especially those who came in later, tend to be among the bigger victims,” said economist Brian Lucey, an associate finance professor at Trinity College Dublin. Ireland was “unique” because the newly made millionaires chose to buy luxury homes in the country rather than abroad. Luxury home prices during the property boom were “underpinned by wealth that wasn’t really wealth,” he said. Investment in housing rose to almost 15 percent of Ireland’s gross domestic product in 2006, up from about 6 percent in 1996, according to the country’s Economic & Social Research Institute. A home formerly owned by Derek Quinlan, once one of Ireland’s richest men, near Shrewsbury Road may be sold to the Belgian Embassy, said two people with knowledge of the matter. The price range is 2.5 million euros to 2.9 million euros, said one of the people, who declined to be identified because the talks aren’t concluded. Quinlan bought the house in 2006 for 7 million euros, and spent more refurbishing it, the Irish Times reported in March, without citing anyone. Damage Done “In Ireland it always used to be a cycle, but this time we seem to have done a lot of damage so the natural recovery isn’t there,” said real-estate developer Paddy Kelly, who owned three houses on Shrewsbury Road at different times and has now lost control of some of his assets as prices plunged. The identity of Walford’s owner hasn’t been disclosed. Iris Keating an agent at Savills, which is jointly handling the sale with Irish broker Lisney, said it received instructions to sell the house from the trust Matsack Nominees Ltd. While luxury cars crowd the driveways of Walford’s neighbors, the red-brick house is run down after being left uninhabited for more than six years. Visitors step onto a bare cement floor just inside the entrance. The walls have been stripped, wooden floors are exposed and cobwebs hang in some of the rooms of the house. ‘Best Road’ After the 75 percent discount, Walford is drawing expressions of interest from potential buyers, Keating said. “This is the best road in Dublin,” she said. “We have had number of genuine inquiries from people who we know to be serious at this end of the market.” Telecom billionaire Denis O’Brien owns a home in Ballsbridge, about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) south of the city center. The Belgian embassy is on the street, as is the residence of the Finnish ambassador. Paddy Kelly is currently leasing a property on Shrewsbury Road to the Chinese embassy. Residential house prices in Dublin have fallen by 51 percent since the peak of the property boom, according to Ireland’s statistics office. The government took control of five of the country’s six biggest lenders, after real-estate loans soured. In all, Ireland has injected or pledged about 62 billion euros to shore up the financial system. Further to Fall Average house prices may fall as much as 70 percent from the peak if the government doesn’t take action to ensure lenders provide mortgages, according to Ronan Lyons , an economist based at Oxford University who has written on the Irish property market. “There is a huge problem at the moment with the availability of credit,” Lyons said in an interview. “Banks are trying to cut down their loan books, not increase them.” Keating at Savills still expects Walford to sell. She estimates that 1 million euros needs to be spent renovating the property. “There are some people who will compete to have a trophy residence here even now,” said Keating at Savills, without naming any of the interested parties. “People at this end of the market want to keep their business under the radar.” To contact the reporters on this story: Finbarr Flynn in Dublin at  fflynn3@bloomberg.net ; Neil Callanan in London at  ncallanan@bloomberg.net ; To contact the editor responsible for this story: Colin Keatinge at  ckeatinge@bloomberg.net' Industry='Real Estate' KeyPoints=\"- Walford, a six-bedroom Edwardian house on Dublin's Shrewsbury Road, is on the market for 15 million euros, down from 58 million euros six years earlier, a 75% decline.\\n- Other trophy properties on the same street, like Thorndene, have seen steep price drops (from 14 million to 8 million euros).\\n- Dublin's luxury housing has fallen about 75% from the peak, vs the broader market down around 51% and the country-wide price drop.\\n- Ireland's financial crisis led the government to seize control of five of the six largest lenders and to inject or pledge about 62 billion euros to support the financial system; credit has tightened.\\n- In contrast, markets like London and Paris saw luxury prices hold up or recover faster due to tight supply and foreign investment; this underscores the divergence within high-end markets.\"\n",

            "Headline='U.S. Apartment Vacancies Drop to Five-Year Low as Demand Begins to Slow' Date='2011-10-06' Link='http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/u-s-apartment-vacancies-drop-to-five-year-low-as-demand-begins-to-slow.html' Article='U.S. apartment vacancies fell to a five-year low in the third quarter, enabling landlords to increase rents even as tepid job growth slowed leasing in what is usually a strong season for demand, Reis Inc. (REIS) said. The vacancy rate dropped to 5.6 percent, the lowest since the third quarter of 2006, the New York-based property-research company said in a report today. It was 5.9 percent in the previous three months and 7.1 percent a year earlier. The average monthly effective rent rose to $1,004 from $997 in the second quarter and $981 in the same period of 2010. Mounting foreclosures, tighter credit for homebuyers and young people moving out on their own have increased demand for apartments after the vacancy rate reached a three-decade high of 8 percent at the end of 2009. Leasing may be starting to cool as the U.S. unemployment rate sticks above 9 percent and concern grows that the economy is weakening, Reis said. Apartment demand in the third quarter “was good, but maybe not as good as it could have been,” Ryan Severino, senior economist at Reis, said in a telephone interview. “Sentiment turned severely negative during August and there was a heightened fear of the economy backsliding.” Landlords saw a net increase in occupied space of about 36,000 units in the third quarter, fewer than the 42,000 units in the previous three months and 95,000 units a year earlier, Reis said. The period is usually one of the strongest for apartment leasing because people tend to move during warmer- weather months and school vacations. Slower ‘Unbundling’ Renewed weakness in the labor market slowed a wave of young people moving out of their parents’ homes or leaving roommates to rent their own place, a phenomenon known as unbundling, said Donald Davidoff, head of marketing for Archstone, the apartment owner based in Englewood, Colorado. The U.S. economy added zero jobs in August, the weakest reading since September 2010, and the unemployment rate remained at 9.1 percent, according to the Labor Department. “The fact that job growth has slowed is certainly not encouraging additional unbundling,” said Davidoff, whose company owns 434 apartment complexes across the U.S. “The pace of that has clearly slowed over the past couple of months.” Vacancies shrank partly because new completions remain near their lowest since Reis began tracking the quarterly data in 1999, Severino said. About 8,200 units came to market in the past three months, the second-lowest quarterly number of the past 12 years, according to Reis. New supply from developers could start affecting occupancy rates in late 2012, Reis said. Effective-Rent Gains Effective rents, or what tenants pay after landlord giveaways are included, rose on a year-over-year basis in 81 out of the 82 metropolitan areas tracked by Reis. San Jose , California , led with 5.5 percent growth in effective rents from a year earlier, followed by San Francisco at 4.5 percent and New York at 3.7 percent, Reis said. Las Vegas was the only city where rents fell. The 2.3 percent annual growth nationwide in effective rents outstripped the 2.1 percent annual increase in landlords’ asking rents, suggesting that concessions continued to decrease amid strong demand for rental housing, Reis said. Vacancies should decline further as the number of jobs increases for people ages 20 to 34, the prime group of renters, said Severino. Lingering pessimism about home prices and the difficulty of qualifying for mortgages also favor the rental market, he said. Pushing Rents “The market hasn’t quite tightened to the point where landlords can really push rents in excess of inflation,” Severino said. “But we’re not too far away. We can envision within the next year or so seeing a figure more in the 3 to 4 percent range” for rent growth. Effective rents have climbed 4.1 percent from their recession low in 2009, according to Reis. Higher rates may spur people to double up again, move home or downsize to a less expensive rental, according to Ron Johnsey, president of Axiometrics Inc., a Dallas-based apartment-research company. Rent growth is “definitely flattening out,” he said. “The operators really pushed rents the first half of the year and then just stood there to protect those gains,” Johnsey said. “It looks like that may be happening again.” William Kendust, a 26-year-old church youth director in the city of Melbourne on Florida ’s eastern shore, moved back in with his parents in January after sharing an apartment with his brother and a friend for two years. “I just felt that it would be throwing money away to rent a place before I was ready” to buy a house, said Kendust, who plans to stay at home longer to help his mom after his father died unexpectedly. “A lot of young people in their 20s want to be able to get up and go, and the opportunity of going back to school is a draw,” Kendust said. “Living with their parents for a while gives them the freedom to do that.” To contact the reporter on this story: Hui-yong Yu in Seattle at  hyu@bloomberg.net ; Katie Spencer in New York at  kspencer14@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Kara Wetzel at  kwetzel@bloomberg.net' Industry='Real Estate' KeyPoints='- U.S. apartment vacancies fell to 5.6% in Q3, the lowest since Q3 2006, signaling a tighter market despite tepid job growth.\\n- Average monthly effective rent rose to $1,004, up from $997 last quarter and $981 a year earlier; nationwide effective rent up 2.3% YoY while asking rents rose 2.1%, indicating fewer concessions.\\n- Demand for rentals driven by foreclosures, tighter mortgage credit, and more young adults moving out; leasing pace slowed as unemployment stayed around 9.1%. \\n- Net occupied space rose about 36,000 in Q3, below Q2’s 42,000 and well below a year earlier; new supply (~8,200 units in the past three months) was near the lowest in Reis’ 12-year history, with potential occupancy impact by late 2012.\\n- Rent growth looks modest but positive in the near term (San Jose +5.5% YoY, San Francisco +4.5%, New York +3.7%; Las Vegas down); national rent growth around 2.3% YoY, with possible 3–4% gains if demand remains solid and supply stays restrained.\\n'\n",

            "Headline='Vietnam Raises a Key Rate to Support Dong, Fight Inflation' Date='2011-10-07' Link='http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/vietnam-central-bank-raises-refinancing-rate-to-15-from-14-.html' Article='Vietnam ’s central bank increased its refinancing rate for the first time since May, as the nation tries to steady its currency and tame Asia ’s fastest inflation. The State Bank of Vietnam raised the refinancing rate to 15 percent from 14 percent, effective Oct. 10, it said in a statement on its website yesterday. The central bank weakened the dong’s reference exchange rate for the third straight day today, to 20,653 per dollar from 20,648 per dollar. Vietnam has struggled to regain investor confidence hurt by inflation of more than 20 percent, a trade deficit and risks in the banking sector. While the rate increase is welcome, the central bank should further tighten monetary conditions if necessary to reassure the market that economic stability remains its top priority, the International Monetary Fund said. “Vietnam had to raise rates, but a rate hike won’t change the weaker dong trend,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian and emerging-markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. “The country has a trade deficit and like many other Asian nations now, money is not flowing into Vietnam either due to risk aversion. The dong will continue to see downward pressure.” The currency was little changed at 20,843 per dollar as of 12:00 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The weakening of the reference exchange rate on Oct. 5 was the first change since Aug. 24. The dong was devalued for the fourth time in 15 months on Feb. 11, by about 7 percent, partly to help curb the trade gap. The VN Index of stocks fell 0.8 percent. No ‘Huge Effect’ The rate increase is “unlikely to have a huge effect on lowering inflation,” Masato Miyazaki, the IMF’s Washington-based mission chief for Vietnam, said in an e-mailed statement received today. The central bank should abolish the cap on deposit rates for dong to “help normalize the monetary transmission mechanism,” Miyazaki said. Asian currencies from the Philippine peso to South Korea ’s won have tumbled against the dollar over the past month, as concern the world economy faces a slump prompts investors to pare bets on emerging markets. Confidence in the dong is “shaky,” according to Viet Capital Securities, which said yesterday the currency was trading at 21,500 per dollar on the black market. The trade deficit widened to $1 billion in September from a revised $396 million in August. Policy Efficiency Vietnam’s move is the first change to a key interest rate under new central bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh and contrasts with neighbors such as Malaysia and China , which left borrowing costs unchanged in recent weeks to shield their economies. The increase in the refinancing rate is aimed at improving “the efficiency of monetary policy” and regulating “market interest rates,” the central bank said in yesterday’s statement. It left its repurchase rate at 14 percent and its discount rate at 13 percent. The State Bank of Vietnam increased the repurchase, refinancing and discount rates earlier this year in an attempt to stem credit growth, slow price gains and stabilize the economy. It raised the repurchase rate in nine steps from 7 percent at the start of November last year to 15 percent in May 2011, before cutting it in July to 14 percent. The government said in August the central bank will consider lowering rates if inflation slows. The latest refinancing rate increase is “an encouraging sign, but we’ll have to see whether it continues,” said Thomas Harr , head of Asian foreign-exchange strategy at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. “Because interest rates in Vietnam are too low, you have a lot of money shifting into gold.” Gold-Backed Loans The State Bank of Vietnam asked commercial banks to provide details of gold-backed loans issued since the start of the year until Oct. 7, according to a separate statement dated yesterday and posted on its website today. Commercial banks will also be obliged to file weekly reports on gold-backed lending to the central bank, with the first reports due Oct. 12, it said. The reporting will help the central bank monitor and stabilize the gold and foreign-exchange markets, it said. The July rate reduction and a government push in August for lower commercial borrowing costs “have created uncertainties about the monetary policy strategy,” Trinh Nguyen, a Hong Kong- based economist at HSBC Holdings Plc, wrote in a note released yesterday before the rate increase was announced. Consumer prices climbed 22.42 percent in September from a year earlier, compared with 23.02 percent in August. Vietnam’s inflation rate remains the fastest in a basket of 17 Asian- Pacific economies tracked by Bloomberg. The central bank yesterday also raised overnight interest rates on electronic transactions to 16 percent from 14 percent, effective Oct. 10. Domestic economic imbalances pose a risk to Vietnamese banks’ asset quality, Moody’s Investors Service said last month. Vietnam’s gross domestic product may rise 5.8 percent in 2011, the slowest pace since 2009, Asian Development Bank data show. The economy, a production hub for companies from Intel Corp. (INTC) to Honda Motor Co., expanded 6.8 percent in 2010.

            "Headline='Harvard Loses Top World University Ranking for First Time' Date='2011-10-06' Link='http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/harvard-loses-top-world-ranking-to-caltech.html' Article='Harvard University lost its top spot for the first time in eight years in a global ranking of higher education institutions, being overtaken by the California Institute of Technology. Another California institution, Stanford University , tied with Harvard for second spot in the annual table compiled by the London-based Times Higher Education , with data supplied by Thomson Reuters Corp. The University of Oxford climbed to fourth from sixth last year, beating the University of Cambridge at sixth. Princeton University came fifth. Harvard, the world’s richest university, has topped the rankings since they were started in 2004. The U.S. institution was beaten by Cambridge last month in a separate poll by higher education information provider QS. A 16 percent increase in research funding for Caltech helped it leapfrog Harvard in the Times Higher table, said Phil Baty, editor of the rankings. “The difference between Harvard and Caltech last year was minuscule,” Baty said in a telephone interview. “What’s happened this year is Caltech has seen a significant increase in its research income. A 16 percent increase, it’s quite significant in tipping the balance over in its favor. Harvard had an increase as well, but it was more in line with sector averages.” The rankings are based on a survey that gauges universities across five areas, including industry income, teaching, citations, research and international outlook. More than 17,500 academics were surveyed and 50 million citations analyzed and compared with the world average for this year’s rankings. Funding Levels “It doesn’t seem as if financial crisis has really damaged Harvard,” said Baty. “It still wins on the teaching indicator. Once you factor in research impact and universities’ research activities, Caltech is slightly better.” U.S. and U.K. universities dominated the list, with 75 American schools in the top 200. Seven of the top 10 schools were in the U.S., with the rest in Britain, Imperial College London taking eighth place. “The real issue that’s starting to show is that the great public American universities do seem to be suffering, whereas the private universities in America have managed to maintain or protect their funding levels a bit more,” Baty said. Premier U.S. universities that depend on public funding, including Californian universities at Berkeley , Los Angeles , San Diego and Santa Barbara , had slipped on the list compared with a year ago, Baty said. ‘Steadfast Donors’ “Caltech is fortunate to have steadfast donors and partners whose support gives Caltech the ability to invest in new ideas long before they would be eligible for public funding opportunities,” Dr. Jean-Lou Chameau, president of Caltech, said in an e-mailed statement. “This public-private partnership model enables our research funds to go further.” Oxford beat Cambridge, the U.K.’s richest university, after a change in the survey’s methodology put arts, humanities and social sciences on an equal footing with science, Baty said. “At places like Oxford, where there’s a slightly heavier focus on humanities and social sciences than there is at Cambridge, that levelling of the playing field has helped,” he said. The U.K. had the most number of universities in the top 200 after the U.S., with 32. U.K. Reforms While the U.K. did “exceptionally well,” the “biggest issue is that we’re entering into a very uncertain period of major reform, which will have unforeseen consequences,” Baty said. Higher tuition fee, spending cuts and new visa restrictions on international students restricting university income will affect U.K. rankings from 2012, he said. “The U.K. is blessed with some truly brilliant universities, more brilliant than the government understands, judging by its hastily concocted higher education reforms, with all the uncertainty they entail,” said Ann Mroz, the editor of the Times Higher, in a report accompanying the list. The Netherlands, Germany and Canada followed the U.S. and U.K. as the countries with most universities on the list. ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , was the highest ranked outside of the U.S. and U.K. at 15th position. The University of Tokyo , in 30th place, was the top-ranked Asian school. Japan has five schools in the top 200, the most of any Asian nation, while Hong Kong has four and China three. Three Taiwanese universities dropped out of the list this year, leaving just one, while India had none.

            "Headline='Hana Financial Pushes for Korea Exchange Takeover After Lone Star Ruling' Date='2011-10-07' Link='http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/lone-star-found-guilty-of-stock-manipulation-in-south-korea-yoo-gets-jail.html' Article='Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) will push to complete its purchase of Korea Exchange Bank from Lone Star Funds after a Seoul court ruled on a five-year legal dispute that stalled the U.S. buyout fund’s efforts to sell the lender. “We will do our utmost to complete the Korea Exchange Bank takeover to best serve our shareholders,” Hana President Kim Jong Yeol said by telephone yesterday after the Seoul High Court found Lone Star guilty of stock-price manipulation. The company is now waiting for guidance from the financial regulator, which said it may order the Dallas-based fund to sell most of its 51 percent stake. Wrangling with courts and regulators pushed back Hana’s plan to take over the bank by May and derailed two earlier attempts by Lone Star to sell its stake. A public backlash over the profits the fund has made on its eight-year investment may deter foreign takeovers in South Korea, impeding government plans to sell state assets such as Woori Finance Holdings Co. “It has taken too long for the resolution of the KEB-Lone Star case,” Hank Morris, North Asia adviser at Triple A Partners Ltd., said by e-mail before the verdict. The delay “will have had a negative effect upon the plans of global investors in regard to direct investment into Korea.” Hana Financial rose 2.5 percent to 36,400 won at the 3 p.m. close of Seoul trading and climbed as high as 38,400 won. Korea Exchange shares advanced 6.5 percent to 7,750 won after rising as much as 11 percent. The benchmark Kospi index advanced 2.9 percent. Lone Star Fined Paul Yoo, the former head of Lone Star’s South Korean unit, was sentenced yesterday to three years in prison by Judge Cho Kyung Ran. Lone Star was fined 25 billion won ($21 million) by the court. Korea Exchange Bank (004940) was found not guilty, Cho said after presiding over a retrial ordered by the Supreme Court this year following their acquittal in June 2008. Judge Cho said Yoo spread false rumors of a possible capital reduction at Korea Exchange Bank’s credit card unit in 2003, with the intention of driving down its value before the lender merged it. The case brought into question whether Lone Star is a legitimate shareholder of Korea Exchange Bank and regulators have waited on its outcome before approving a change in ownership. ‘It Doesn’t Matter’ “It doesn’t matter whether Lone Star voluntarily sells the stake or is forced to do so,” Kim Sung Yong, a law professor at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, said before the judgment. “The result is the same: exit from its investment as it has wished.” Korea Exchange Bank spokesman Lee Sun Hwan said the company respects the court’s decision on the lender. He declined to comment on the Financial Services Commission’s remark that it may order Lone Star to sell a 41 percent stake. Jed Repko, a spokesman for Lone Star in New York , declined to comment on the court’s decision and on whether the fund will appeal to the highest court again. He also declined to comment on the regulator’s remarks that the commission may order Lone Star to sell 41 percent stake in Korea Exchange. Hana has lost 18 percent since May 12, when the Financial Services Commission said it wouldn’t approve Hana’s proposed acquisition of Korea Exchange until Lone Star’s legal dispute is resolved. The FSC has left the deal in limbo for almost a year because of the litigation, prompting Hana and Lone Star to extend a deadline for the transaction to Nov. 30 from May and trim the purchase price by 6 percent to 4.4 trillion won. Hard Sell Lone Star shouldn’t be allowed to get so high price from the Korea Exchange Bank stake following the conviction, Yu Won Il, an opposite Creative Korea Party lawmaker, said at a parliamentary audit today. “Public will never understand if after being convicted of criminal stock manipulation, Lone Star takes a huge premium from this stake sale,” Yu told Financial Services Commission Chairman Kim Seok Dong today. Lone Star, which bought Korea Exchange Bank in 2003, first tried to sell the lender to Kookmin Bank in 2006, and the deal was thwarted amid the same legal dispute. Then in 2008, HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) walked away from a $6 billion deal to buy Korea Exchange as regulators delayed approval, citing the case. While the court proceedings have postponed Lone Star’s exit, it has profited from the investment. The U.S. fund has recovered 2.5 trillion won after tax through block share sales and dividends out of a 2.15 trillion won investment in Korea Exchange, according to the bank’s data. Hostile Sentiment South Korean civic groups such as Seoul-based SpecWatch Korea have criticized foreign investors including Lone Star for pursuing an “eat-and-flee” strategy of buying companies and selling them quickly, pocketing big profits. Public discord and the U.S. buyout firm’s legal woes have dissuaded foreign investors from acquiring Korean companies, said Henry Seggerman, president of New York-based International Investment Advisers. “The case is extremely negative for any prospective strategic investors,” Seggerman, whose firm manages the $25 million Korea International Investment Fund, said by e-mail before the decision. “Public sentiment is hostile toward profitable overseas investment, not supportive overseas investment.” Overseas takeovers of Korean companies fell to $3.6 billion last year from a record $8.1 billion in 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lone Star was one of the first overseas firms to invest in South Korea following the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis that led the country to accept a $57 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
