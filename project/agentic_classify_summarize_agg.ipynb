Greece is trying to dispel criticism it’s not doing enough to sell real estate pledged as part of its 240 billion-euro ($315 billion) rescue. “It’s literally haunting the Greek budget,” Andreas Taprantzis, executive director for real estate at the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund, said in an interview. It “generates zero income, not even taxes,” he said. Hobbled by red tape, a dearth of demand, political resistance and frequent delays, Greek state asset sales haven’t brought in the revenue demanded by the international lenders who bailed out the country. The creditors have signaled they will be taking a more critical look at the strategies being used when they begin their next quarterly review this month. With more than 70,000 properties ranging from a luxury beach resort on the Athenian coast to a disused car repair shop, real estate accounts for half of the 50 billion euros the government originally pledged to raise from selling assets. Greek EBay For about 1,000 small buildings, offices and homes owned by the state, online auctions have been picked as the best way to quickly and transparently move them off Greece’s books, Taprantzis said, calling it an “E-Bay for Greek real estate.” The process is “smart and efficient,” said Lefteris Farmakis, an analyst at Nomura International in London. “But it’s not going to be easy to generate serious revenue, given the illiquid nature of real estate investments and the legal obstacles they face in Greece.” The fund has sold three properties via e-auctions since they started in July, raising 7.4 million euros, and has a slate of seven properties due for the e-block this month. The assets on sale range from a tract of beachfront property in northern Greece to a four-story office building in central Athens. Starting bids will range from 310,000 euros for No. 4 Smolenski Street, a stone mansion built in the 1930s in the seaside neighborhood of Neo Faliro, to 3.4 million euros for the commercial property. Sales Targets The government is targeting annual sales of 35 million euros to 50 million euros from the online auctions, according to Tapranztis, who was appointed in July 2011. Raising money efficiently from Greek real estate assets is a priority for the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, the troika of lenders who may soon need to discuss options for a third financial package of aid for Greece. Their continued support rests on Greece reducing debt to less than 124 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 from a projected peak of 176 percent this year. The revenue target for asset sales, used to pay down debt, has been repeatedly revised. The initial goal of 50 billion euros by the end of 2015 was scaled back to 24 billion euros by 2020. Greece’s failure in June to sell national gas company Depa SA is the latest setback to the plan. Foreign Managers? The IMF said in June the government should consider bringing in foreign managers to run the asset-sales fund, known as HRADF, should the program run further behind schedule. “If the comprehensive review of the privatization program scheduled for the fall of 2013 suggests that delays are continuing -- in particular that political interference continues to hamper the process -- more far-reaching governance changes to the HRADF must be considered,” it said. For the real estate, the IMF said in a separate report a month later, alternative methods, such as asset securitization, are being assessed to boost revenue beyond what’s currently foreseen in the privatization plan. Taprantzis, 47, said the fund is seeking financial advisers for the securitization and expects to name a winner this month with a view to having a first transaction in the second quarter of 2014, he said. It’s not just ghosts haunting Greece’s real estate market, which Taprantzis describes as “at best, dead.” Six-Year Slump Greece is in a sixth year of recession, with unemployment topping a record 27 percent. House prices dropped almost 12 percent in the second quarter of the year, according to the central bank, and the lifting a foreclosure ban on some properties may damp the market further. While the starting price for Smolenski Street in Athens might look like a bargain, years of neglect is restricting the amount that Greece can raise from the assets. Taprantzis said the sale of a mansion in the traditionally wealthy inner-city neighborhood of Kolonaki in July fetched 1.1 million euros. The property could need as much as 2 million euros in refurbishment costs, so “it’s not for everybody.” The online auctions will be used for assets valued at less than 5 or 6 million euros, Tsaprantzis said. Anything valued at more than that would probably require an international tender. The fund plans to sell another cluster of assets the state owns outside Greece after selling buildings such as a townhouse in Holland Park, one of London’s wealthiest neighborhoods. That may include a Roman hotel bequeathed to the Greek state by a Greek living in Italy , valued at about 14 million euros. A hotel in Athens is also due to be auctioned. The vast majority of assets to be auctioned online have come to the Greek state’s possession through foreclosures, bequests or donations or after their owners died without heirs. “Many people end up with no heirs and eventually the state inherits the property,” Taprantzis said by telephone. “The state is family for all citizens, including the ones with no heirs but with a fortune.” To contact the reporter on this story: Maria Petrakis in Athens at mpetrakis@bloomberg.net  To contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephen Foxwell at sfoxwell@bloomberg.net'}"

Cutout values are separated into three main product\\n  types. Fabricated loads are beef cuts taken from an animal\\'\\'s ribs, chuck, round,\\n  loin, brisket, short plate and flank; 50 percent loads are 50 percent lean beef\\n  trimmings. Ground loads may contain 73, 75, or 80 percent ground beef. A typical\\n  refrigerated truckload carries 40,000 pounds. Choice 1-3 grade is a better grade\\n  than Select 1-3, partly because Choice cuts have more fat, or marbling, than Select\\n  cuts. Grade quality is determined using a 1-5 yield grade scale. A rating of 1 is\\n  the highest ratio of muscle to fat, while 5 is the lowest.  Marbling is an important\\n  flavor factor.\\'\\nIndustry: Consumer Staples\\nKeyPoints: The article provides daily closing prices for boxed beef cutouts from the\\n  USDA. It details the prices for Choice and Select cuts, along with changes from\\n  the prior day. The article includes the total load count and a summary of values\\n  for the prior five days. It presents negotiated sales data, including volume and\\n  prices for different cuts. The article lists prices for various beef sub-primals\\n  with fat limitations.\\n\\nHeadline: U.S. September Small Business Jobs Summary\\nDate: \\'2011-10-06\\'\\nLink: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/u-s-september-small-business-jobs-summary-table-.html\\nArticle: \\'U.S. small business plans to hire declined in September, according to the\\n  National Federation of Independent Business.

In June, Connecticut adopted\\\\\\n  \\\\ a measure for a so-called green bank, designed to provide low-cost financing for\\\\\\n  \\\\ energy-efficiency projects. The project will be funded by a surcharge on residential\\\\\\n  \\\\ and commercial electric bills amounting to about $30 million a year. Legislators\\\\\\n  \\\\ in Oregon , Michigan , Pennsylvania , Ohio and New York have reached out to Hundt\\\\u2019\\\\\\n  s coalition to do something similar, he said. Venture funding of clean-tech companies\\\\\\n  \\\\ fell 4.5 percent in the first half of this year to $2.17 billion from $2.27 billion\\\\\\n  \\\\ a year earlier, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Still,\\\\\\n  \\\\ the $1.23 billion invested in the first quarter marked the second-highest period\\\\\\n  \\\\ ever, after the second quarter of 2010, the NVCA said. That won\\\\u2019t slow down\\\\\\n  \\\\ just because Solyndra is being scrutinized, said Jim Fulton, co-chair of the clean\\\\\\n  \\\\ energy and technologies group at law firm Cooley LLP in Palo Alto, California,\\\\\\n  \\\\ which sponsored the conference. Congressional Republicans are leading an investigation\\\\\\n  \\\\ into Solyndra\\\\u2019s loan guarantee, and the company faces a probe by the FBI.\\\\\\n  \\\\ \\\\u201CSolyndra will not be a defining moment in clean-tech history,\\\\u201D Fulton\\\\\\n  \\\\ said in an interview. \\\\u201CThere is an alternative universe in Washington , D.C.,\\\\\\n  \\\\ and politics that is blowing this out of proportion.\\\\u201D Hundt, 63, also works\\\\\\n  \\\\ with the Aspen Institute , which describes itself as a \\\\u201Cvenue for discussing\\\\\\n  \\\\ and acting on critical issues,\\\\u201D and worked on President Barack Obama\\\\u2019\\\\\\n  s transition team from 2008 to 2009.

In the 2008-9 season taxes averaged 25.3 percent of international prices, the IMF said in a document posted on its website in November last year. While the country met the commitment in the season just ended, it had a change in government earlier this year. The rate meets a demand by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to reform the Ivorian cocoa and coffee industries in order to comply with the terms of its Heavily Indebted Poor Countries’ debt-relief program. Last year, the fixed duty on cocoa beans was scrapped and replaced with a levy that varies with prices as part of the reforms that will make the country eligible for $3 billion in debt relief from the Washington-based lenders. The document from the Abidjan-based ministry is dated Oct. 3 and applies to the 2011-12 harvest season, which began on Oct. 1. It was obtained by Bloomberg and hasn’t been publicly released. Norbert Komenan, an adviser to Finance Minister, Charles Koffi Diby, declined to comment when called today. The main export tax has been maintained at 14.6 percent. There are a number of other charges. Cocoa traded at $2,648 a metric ton in New York as of 11:03 a.m. local time. Disputed Election Discussions of the reform strategy with the World Bank are expected to resume in coming months, the IMF said on its website in July, two months after Alassane Ouattara was sworn in as president following a violent five-month political crisis that was sparked by a disputed November election. Cocoa and coffee exports were largely halted during that time, as Ouattara attempted to limit the flow of funds to Laurent Gbagbo , who refused to cede power despite losing the election. Businesses also shut their doors as customers stayed home and banks closed their branches amid the clashes. As many as 3,000 people were killed, according to the International Criminal Court , which is investigating crimes it says were committed by supporters of both leaders. Ivory Coast’s economy may contract 5.8 percent this year before expanding 8.5 percent in 2012, the ministry said last month.

Sterling dropped against all but two of its 16 major counterparts, sliding most versus the Australian dollar. The Monetary Policy Committee will leave its key rate unchanged at 0.5 percent, according to all 53 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Eleven of 32 economists surveyed separately predict at least a 50 billion-pound ($77 billion) increase in its so- called quantitative easing program. “There might be a short relief rally in sterling on a lack of further BOE action but it’s likely to be short-lived as the market is still focused on the likelihood of further QE by the November meeting,” said Ian Stannard , London-based head of European currency strategy at Morgan Stanley. “The BOE will move towards further QE in coming months and ultimately sterling will come under pressure.” The pound weakened 0.1 percent to $1.5439 at 8:54 a.m. in London. It declined 0.2 percent to 118.47 yen and was little changed against the euro at 86.36 pence. Morgan Stanley recommends selling the pound on any “relief rallies” that are likely to occur should the central bank refrain from announcing further monetary stimulus for the U.K. economy. The Bank of England has faced pressure to embark on further quantitative easing to help revive an economy battling the steepest government spending cuts since World War II and a worsening euro-area debt crisis. The U.K.’s economy grew less than expected in the second quarter, expanding 0.1 percent from the first three months of the year, the Office for National Statistics said yesterday. That was lower than the 0.2 percent previously published by the statistics body and also missed the 0.2 percent expansion forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. U.K. 10-year gilt yields were three basis points lower at 2.34 percent and the two-year note yield was little changed at 0.58 percent.

The three-year loan program is likely to come to the board of directors for approval in November, the Washington-based IMF said in an e-mailed statement today. The IMF has said its support was contingent on the country’s strengthening its financial system. “The authorities have made important progress on managing the Kabul Bank crisis that came to the fore in the fall of 2010,” IMF mission chief Axel Schimmelpfennig said in the statement. “The authorities’ program outlines further steps to strengthen and develop Afghanistan’s financial sector.” A loan would signal approval of Afghanistan’s policies, a condition for some governments that provide assistance. The IMF, which reached a similar agreement in July 2010 that never went to the board, had said Afghan authorities needed to prevent a repeat of the conditions that led to the collapse of Kabul Bank before obtaining aid. The government took over Kabul Bank, the country’s biggest commercial financial institution, in September 2010. Thousands of depositors rushed to withdraw their money last year after learning that the bank’s owners had lost hundreds of millions of dollars they had lent to themselves. Recovering Assets “Kabul Bank has been put into receivership, and efforts are under way to recover the embezzled assets from the former shareholders of the bank which will limit the fiscal costs of the crisis,” Schimmelpfennig said. “The central bank is also stepping up supervision and ensuring that the banking law and regulations are fully enforced.” Measures the Afghan government plans to take in exchange for the loan include introducing a value-added tax to make up for the expected decrease in revenue collection when the military withdraws. The IMF said it expects real economic growth of between 6 percent and 8 percent during the program period.

Cutout values are separated into three main product types. Fabricated loads are beef cuts taken from an animal\\'s ribs, chuck, round, loin, brisket, short plate and flank; 50 percent loads are 50 percent lean beef trimmings. Ground loads may contain 73, 75, or 80 percent ground beef. A typical refrigerated truckload carries 40,000 pounds. Choice 1-3 grade is a better grade than Select 1-3, partly because Choice cuts have more fat, or marbling, than Select cuts. Grade quality is determined using a 1-5 yield grade scale. A rating of 1 is the highest ratio of muscle to fat, while 5 is the lowest.  Marbling is an important flavor factor.'

            "Headline='Clean-Tech Companies Should Get 10-Year Tax Breaks, Hundt Says' Date='2011-10-06' Link='http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/clean-tech-companies-should-get-10-year-tax-breaks-hundt-says.html' Article='Reed Hundt, head of the Coalition for Green Capital, said alternative-energy companies should be given a 10-year tax break on profits as a way to create jobs and stimulate innovation in clean technology. Hundt, who was chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission from 1993 to 1997, is working with the government as well as Silicon Valley venture capital and private equity firms to ensure that money is still available for clean-energy projects after the collapse of Solyndra LLC last month. “Step one is that the Silicon Valley venture community has to stand up for the fundamental idea that success can come from failure,” Hundt said in an interview at a clean-tech conference yesterday in Redwood City, California. “And this is a Congress that hates taxes, so how about eliminating all income tax on the sale of clean-energy goods or services for the next decade.” Solyndra, a solar-panel maker in Fremont, California , fired 1,100 workers and filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 6, two years after receiving a $535 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy. The company’s downfall doesn’t change the need for the production of biofuels, solar power and technology that helps reduce energy consumption, Hundt said. State Initiatives In addition to making proposals to Congress, Hundt’s Washington-based nonprofit is working with individual states to make capital more available. In June, Connecticut adopted a measure for a so-called green bank, designed to provide low-cost financing for energy-efficiency projects. The project will be funded by a surcharge on residential and commercial electric bills amounting to about $30 million a year. Legislators in Oregon , Michigan , Pennsylvania , Ohio and New York have reached out to Hundt’s coalition to do something similar, he said. Venture funding of clean-tech companies fell 4.5 percent in the first half of this year to $2.17 billion from $2.27 billion a year earlier, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Still, the $1.23 billion invested in the first quarter marked the second-highest period ever, after the second quarter of 2010, the NVCA said. That won’t slow down just because Solyndra is being scrutinized, said Jim Fulton, co-chair of the clean energy and technologies group at law firm Cooley LLP in Palo Alto, California, which sponsored the conference. Congressional Republicans are leading an investigation into Solyndra’s loan guarantee, and the company faces a probe by the FBI. “Solyndra will not be a defining moment in clean-tech history,” Fulton said in an interview. “There is an alternative universe in Washington , D.C., and politics that is blowing this out of proportion.” Hundt, 63, also works with the Aspen Institute , which describes itself as a “venue for discussing and acting on critical issues,” and worked on President Barack Obama’s transition team from 2008 to 2009. He serves on the board of Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s biggest semiconductor company, and Serious Energy Inc., formerly Serious Materials, which provides software for building owners and developers.

Some 16,000 workers spread between Hamburg, where Airbus assembles single-aisle planes, and Bremen, Stade, and Buxtehude, where plane structures are built, have been asked to leave their work stations and gather for rallies, the IG Metall union said in a statement today. Workers and management have been tussling over new contracts that will run through 2020. Management has already agreed to offer job guarantees and is seeking 8 percent productivity increases. Workers say that’s too much and are offering 2 percent productivity gains instead. “Both sides agree that we need to make productivity increases, and management is waiting for them to come back to the table. It’s important to reach a conclusion,” said Florian Seidel, a spokesman for Airbus in Hamburg. Seidel said Airbus doesn’t expect the work actions to last more than an hour or two and said management is eager to resolve differences quickly. Management and labor have different methods of calculating the productivity increases, Seidel said. The strike is planned to stretch over three shifts at the four production centers tomorrow, said Heiko Messerschmidt, a spokesman for the IG Metall labor union for the coastal region, who spoke by telephone from Hamburg. He predicted “several thousand” workers will show up at rallies. “We hope that these actions will put enough pressure on Airbus to return to the negotiation table,” said Messerschmidt. “We know that flexibility is a requirement, but not at any price.” In Germany workers are required to give notice before staging any strike action. Airbus had gone to court in September to block any such action, a bid that was thrown out. Airbus assembles single-aisle A320, A319, A321 and A318 planes in Hamburg and also assembles the bulk of the A320s in Toulouse, France , where Airbus is based.

            "Headline='Farmland Seen Returning Up to 12% by U.S. Pensions Manager' Date='2011-10-06' Link='http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/farmland-seen-returning-up-to-12-by-469-billion-fund-manager.html' Article='Farmland investments may return an average of 8 percent to 12 percent annually as global food demand increases, said the largest U.S. pension manager for teachers and academic researchers with $469 billion of assets. The company has $2.5 billion invested in farmland and owns about 600,000 hectares (1.48 million acres) mostly in the U.S., Brazil and Australia, said Jose Minaya, 40, a managing director and head of natural resources and infrastructure investments at New York-based TIAA-CREF. “From a historical point of view, farmland has generated returns of 8 percent to 12 percent a year and we expect that to continue over the long term,” Minaya said. Farms are attracting investors such as billionaire George Soros as rising incomes in China and India and a growing world population increase demand for food and fuel. Food production will have to climb 70 percent by 2050 as the population rises to 9.2 billion from 6.9 billion in 2010, according to the United Nations. Global food costs reached a record in February after weather ruined crops from Canada to Australia and Russia. The Standard & Poor’s Spot Index of 24 commodities has dropped 21 percent from its April high on concern the European debt crisis would slow growth and curb demand. The gauge had more than doubled since the start of 2009. The MSCI All-Country World Index of global equities lost 22 percent from its May high. ‘Pretty Steady’ Farmland is an asset class that’s “pretty steady” and delivers stable income returns with capital appreciation that tracks slightly above inflation, said Minaya, who previously worked for AIG Global Investment Group and Merrill Lynch & Co. The company is seeking to expand in grain-exporting countries and hold investments for as long as 30 years, he said in an interview Sept. 30. “We can easily be twice the size that we are today” if the right opportunities arise, he said. The pension manager buys land and leases it back to farmers, he said. The investments are in “mature and established” regions, in “the bigger farms” and in countries that export grain, he said. Returns in the past few years have been at the high end of the 8 percent to 12 percent range, he said Sept. 30. “On aggregate, it does look like a pretty good bet,” said Michael Creed , an agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. “We’re entering a period of rapid growth in emerging- market demand for higher protein,” which is increasing use of grains to feed poultry and livestock, he said from Melbourne. Farmland Values TIAA-CREF is one of eight institutional investors representing $1.3 trillion in assets that have endorsed a set of Farmland Principles ranging from environmental sustainability to transparency and respect for land rights, it said on Sept. 6. Farmland values in one of the most-productive regions in the U.S. Midwest soared 17 percent in the second quarter as higher grain prices made real estate more attractive, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said on Aug. 17. The increase from a year ago in the area including Illinois , Indiana , Iowa and Wisconsin was the biggest since the 1970s, it said. A fund controlled by George Soros owns 23 percent of South American farmland venture Adecoagro SA, Bloomberg data show. The company is involved in the production of grains, oilseeds, dairy, sugar, ethanol, coffee, cotton and cattle meat, and has operations in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, its website said. Shrinking land and water supply in countries including China and India, will limit their capacity to boost food production, creating import demand, Minaya said. That’s going to be met by the major exporting regions in North and South America, Australia, and parts of Central and Eastern Europe, he said. As well as the U.S., Australia and Brazil, the company has a smaller level of investments in Poland and Romania , he said.
